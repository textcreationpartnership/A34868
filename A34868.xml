            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF the Dedication of this poor Work unto you, may carry with it any intimation of the great Reſpect and Honour I have for you, I deſire the world ſhould underſtand the ground of it; which is not ſo much the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of your Quality and outward Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (though that alſo deſerves its due value and regard) as your eminent Piety and Vertue, which renders you truly honourable, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the eſteem of all good men. And truly I cannot but look upon it as a great teſtimony of the Divine favour to that <hi>Noble Family</hi> to which you are all ſo nearly related, and a great honour to it, That in an Age ſo corrupt and depraved as this is, there ſhould be found in it
<pb facs="tcp:50384:3"/> ſo many Perſons more <hi>ennobled</hi> by their <hi>Virtue</hi> than their <hi>High Birth;</hi> and more <hi>great</hi> in <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>real Worth,</hi> than in <hi>Eſtate.</hi> May the Bleſſing of God Almighty ever reſt on You and your Families, and make you ſtill great Examples of all that is good and praiſe-worthy, in the places where you live; that when you ſhall have finiſhed your courſe, and ſerved your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration here according to the will of God, and are entred into your everlaſting Reſt, your Names may be to the ſucceeding Age as a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume</hi> poured forth.</p>
            <p>As for what concerns this Work, you may pleaſe to underſtand, That it is the fruit of ſome of my hours of leiſure and retirement, of which I have had more of late years than ever I deſired or expected. And ſurely <hi>tam otii quam negotii reddenda eſt ratio,</hi> as he ſaid: We muſt give account to God of our times of leiſure, as well as of thoſe of publick and viſible em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. For thoſe ſeveral years laſt paſt, wherein I have been confined to privacy, I have addicted my ſelf to the ſerious ſtudy of the Holy Scriptures, not finding any way wherein I could better employ my time. For where can we find that profit, that delight, that comfort in afflictions, which may be reaped from a diligent peruſal and ſerious meditation on thoſe Sacred and Divinely-inſpir'd Writings? I have often thought with my ſelf, that a ſhort and plain Analytical Paraphraſe and Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, might be of great uſe to thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:50384:3"/> who have not leiſure to read larger Comments. And accordingly I have bent my pains to ſerve them therein, as I was able. If my poor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours may be any ways ſerviceable to the Church of God, I ſhall rejoyce. However, as our bleſſed Saviour ſaid in excuſe of <hi>Mary</hi> when ſhe was blamed for pouring her Box of precious Ointment on his Head (<hi>Mar.</hi> 14.4, &amp;c.), <hi>Let her alone, ſhe hath done what ſhe could;</hi> intimating, that if ſhe had known how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her high veneration and affection to Him in a better manner, ſhe would have willingly done it: So I hope I may in ſome meaſure of ſincerity and uprightneſs ſay, that <hi>I have done what I could.</hi> If I had known how to do any thing better for the ſervice of God and His Church, in the Circumſtances wherein I have of late years been caſt, I hope I ſhould have readily done it. But ſeeing I did not, I have (humbly imploring the Divine Aſſiſtance) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured on this.</p>
            <p>'Tis well known, that there is nothing in this world more pleaſing and cheering to the eyes, than <hi>Light;</hi> inſomuch that one elegantly calls it <hi>The ſmile of Nature.</hi> And in like manner, to the Mind and Underſtanding of man, there is nothing more pleaſing and delightful than a clear diſcovery of <hi>Truth.</hi> But of all Truths, there are none can be ſo acceptable, ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and raviſhing, as <hi>thoſe glorious Truths</hi> revealed by God in his holy Word, which tend ſo much to the bettering of <hi>man</hi> here, and to the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:50384:4"/> of him to eternal happineſs hereafter. And truly I am very confident, would Perſons of Quality and Education more diligently read and ſtudy the Holy Scriptures, they would find ſuch incomparable delight, ſweetneſs, and comfort in them, that <hi>Play-books</hi> and <hi>Romances,</hi> and ſuch corrupting and effeminating Traſh (which conſume the precious hours of too many of our Gentry) would ſeem vile and contemptible in their eyes. But I need not ſay theſe things to you, who know how better to employ your time, and have learned to prefer <hi>Manna</hi> before Onions and Garlick.</p>

            <p>HAving lately publiſhed the intire Hiſtory of our <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord and Saviour,</hi> from his Birth to his glorious <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> to Heaven; it will not be, I hope, unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to thee, if I here preſent thee with the Hiſtory of the <hi>Church</hi> immediately ſucceeding; and give thee a Narrative of the <hi>Acts, Labours, Travels, Sermons, Diſcourſes, Miracles, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of the Holy Apoſtles, as they are record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> in that Divine Book of his, call'd the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that my Deſign in this undertaking may the more clearly be diſcerned, be pleaſed to underſtand, that I have digeſted the whole Work into <hi>Seven Chapters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The FIRST CHAPTER contains the Acts of all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>joyntly,</hi> from our Saviour's Aſcenſion to <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Converſion;</hi> and ſhews what was done by them <hi>before</hi> the Feaſt of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt, <hi>at</hi> the Feaſt, and <hi>after</hi> it. (1.) <hi>Before the Feaſt;</hi> it ſhews how they continued in joynt-devotion for ten days together at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in expectation of the great <hi>promiſed effuſion</hi> of the Spirit; and during that time, called <hi>Matthias</hi> by lot to the Apoſtleſhip in the room of <hi>Judas [Acts</hi> chap. I.] 2. <hi>At the Feaſt;</hi> it ſhews how they received a <hi>plentiful effuſion</hi> of the Spirit, and ſpake <hi>divers Tongues;</hi> at which ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> mocking, <hi>Peter</hi> preached an excellent Sermon to them, which had ſuch wonderful ſucceſs, that by his own and the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles endeavours, about Three thouſand were that day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Chriſt [<hi>Acts</hi> Chap. II.]. (3.) <hi>After the Feaſt;</hi> it relates how <hi>PETER</hi> going up to the Temple with <hi>John,</hi> he there
<pb facs="tcp:50384:5"/> miraculouſly cured a <hi>Cripple.</hi> The people being filled with amazement and aſtoniſhment at this <hi>miracle, Peter</hi> informs them, That it was not wrought by any power of his own, but by the power of Jeſus Chriſt. And from hence he takes occaſion to preach Chriſt to them (Chap. III.). The <hi>Rulers</hi> of the Jews being offended at his Sermon (though a great number of the people were converted thereby), apprehend <hi>him</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and bring them before the <hi>Council,</hi> who after examination diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs them, yet with a charge not to preach any more in the Name of Jeſus. The Church hereupon betake themſelves to prayer, and receive a preſent and gracious anſwer from the Lord.

            <p>Immediately after <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Martyrdom, a violent Perſecution aroſe, which ſcattered the Diſciples at <hi>Jeruſalem.

Laſtly, It ſets forth how <hi>Philip</hi> was ſent to inſtruct and baptize the Eunuch [<hi>Acts</hi> Chap. VIII].</p>
            <p>The SECOND CHAPTER contains more particularly the Hiſtory of thoſe two great Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> though there is inſerted alſo ſomething concerning <hi>Barnabas</hi>'s journey to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and the Martyrdom of <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now concerning <hi>PA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L,</hi> theſe things are here related: (1.) His
<pb facs="tcp:50384:5"/> miraculous Converſion. (2.) His Vocation to the Apoſtleſhip. (3.) His Preaching Chriſt firſt in the Synagogues of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and then in <hi>Arabia</hi> for the ſpace of three years. (4.) His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Damaſcus</hi> and eſcaping the hands of the Jews that there conſpired to kill him.</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Peter,</hi> theſe things are recorded: (1.) The <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> he wrought, namely, his healing <hi>Aeneas</hi> of the Palſie at <hi>Lydda,</hi> and raiſing <hi>Tabitha</hi> from the dead at <hi>Joppa [Acts</hi> Chap.

The <hi>Doctrine</hi> he preached to <hi>Cornelius</hi> (a <hi>Gentile</hi>) and his company, upon a particular viſion and command from God; whereupon the Holy Ghoſt falleth on them, and they are baptized [<hi>Acts</hi> Chap.

This is the laſt we hear of this <hi>great Apoſtle</hi> (excepting his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent at the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Act. 15.) till we come to his Epiſtles. As for <hi>Paul,</hi> the remainder of his ſtory falls within the time and compaſs of his travels, and thoſe Five re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Journeys of his which are deſcribed in the Five en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Chapters.</p>
            <p>The THIRD CHAPTER contains a Narration of <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Firſt Journey</hi> from <hi>Antioch</hi> with <hi>Barnabas,</hi> to preach the Goſpel to the <hi>Gentiles, John-Mark</hi> being their Miniſter: At which time they travelled to <hi>Cyprus, Pamphylia, Lycaonia, Piſidia,</hi> and other Provinces of <hi>Aſia</hi> the Leſs. And therefore this Journey we may call for diſtinction-ſake, <hi>Iter Aſiaticum;</hi> It is deſcribed <hi>Acts</hi> Chap. XIII, XIV.</p>
            <p>The FOURTH CHAPTER contains <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Second Journey</hi> with <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and others, from <hi>Antioch</hi> to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which we may therefore call <hi>Iter Hieroſolomitanum.</hi> It is deſcribed <hi>Acts</hi> Chap.

            <p>The FIFTH CHAPTER contains <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Third Journey,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompanied with <hi>Silas</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> to viſit and confirm the
<pb facs="tcp:50384:6"/> Diſciples in thoſe Cities where <hi>He</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had before preached the Goſpel; which done, they were called by a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion over into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and ſo paſſed into <hi>Europe,</hi> and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>Philippi, Beroea, Theſſalonica, Athens, Corinth,</hi> and ſo by <hi>Epheſus</hi> returned into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> and then came back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to <hi>Antioch.</hi> This Journey we may call <hi>Iter Graecum</hi> ſive <hi>Macedonicum.</hi> It is deſcribed from <hi>ver.</hi> 36 of Chap. XV, to <hi>ver.</hi> 23 of Chap. XVIII.</p>
            <p>The SIXTH CHAPTER contains <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Fourth Journey,</hi> which he began from <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> from whence he went to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> according to his promiſe, and ſtaying the <hi>greateſt part</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Which Journey is deſcribed from <hi>ver.</hi> 23 of Chap. XVIII, to Chap. XXVII</p>
            <p>The SEVENTH CHAPTER contains <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Fifth</hi> and <hi>Laſt Journey</hi> from <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In <hi>theſe Seven Chapters</hi> I have compriſed the Divine Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi> Poſſibly ſome may now ask How it can be properly ſo called, ſeeing it chiefly relates the ſtory of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> and of the <hi>former</hi> but ſparingly, and inſiſts principally upon the Acts of the <hi>later,</hi> mentioning but little what the other Apoſtles <hi>did,</hi> or what Churches they <hi>planted,</hi> or what <hi>death</hi> they died. For anſwer to which, this is all that can be ſaid, That it ſeemed good to the Spirit of God to have only <hi>ſo much</hi> written as he ſaw conducing to our edification; and in that we are to acquieſce. Beſides, <hi>Luke</hi> who wrote the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> was a diſciple and follower of <hi>Paul,</hi> and his Companion in moſt of his Travels; and therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if he deſigned principally to write <hi>his Story.</hi> To all which we may add, That as <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Converſion</hi> was more miraculous than the converſion of any other of the Apoſtles, ſo the courſe of his Miniſtry was more illuſtrious. <hi>He laboured more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly than they all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>Hierom</hi>

He is thought to have written it in the 62 year of Chriſt, and the 6th of <hi>Nero.</hi> We have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this Divine Book ſet before us, an Hiſtory of the <hi>riſe, growth, ſtate, and practice of the primitive Church, in the pureſt Apoſtolical times;</hi> and a declaration of the <hi>pure doctrine then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and of the pure Worſhip and Church-Government and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline then practiſed.</hi> All which may be a pattern to ſucceeding Churches in all ages.

But without any ground. For the words ſpeak evidently of a deliverance from a paenal condition, whereas the Papiſts themſelves hold that Chriſts Soul was triumphant in Hell.

But theſe words in their proper and literal ſenſe could not be ſpoken of <hi>David,</hi> becauſe <hi>David</hi>'s body was left in the grave and was there corrupted [See <hi>Act.</hi> 13.36.37. compar'd with 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.10.] and therefore they muſt needs have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Chriſt, who (as <hi>David</hi> ſaw by the Spirit of Prophecy) was to ſpring from his Loins.

In the time of this Edict, <hi>Moſes</hi> was born to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> and <hi>Jochebed</hi> his wife, who being a very lovely child, his Parents hid him three months in their houſe; but at laſt not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to conceal him any longer, they put him in a basket of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſhes, daubed over with flime and pitch, and laid it in the flags by the ſide of the River.

When he grew to the age of Forty, it came into his mind to viſit his brethren the Iſraelites; and among other things that evidenced to him their ſad condition, he ſaw an Egyptian ſmiting an Iſraelite, which ſo ſtirred up his ſpirit, that he ſlew the Egyptian who did the wrong, thereby giving the Iſraelites the firſt intimation, that God would deliver them by his hand, (which it ſeems God had by inſtinct, or revelation made known unto himſelf,) but they underſtood it not. The next day ſeeing two Iſraelites at variance, he would have made them friends, and ſet them <hi>at one</hi> again. But he, who did the wrong upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him for it, and ſaid, <hi>Who made thee a ruler, and a judg over us? wilt thou kill me as thou didſt the Egyptian yeſterday? Moſes</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:50384:27"/> perceiving hereby, that what he had done to the Egyptian was known, and that the King hereupon would ſeek his life, he fled from thence into the land <hi>Midian,</hi> where he ſpent other Forty years of his life, and married <hi>Zippora, Jethro</hi>'s daughter, and by her had two Sons. The children of Iſrael continuing ſtill under ſore bondage in Egypt; it pleaſed the Lord now at length to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate them, and to reſolve to deliver them. Wherefore, when <hi>Moſes</hi> had been Forty years in <hi>Midian,</hi> as he was keeping his father-in-laws ſheep about <hi>Horeb,</hi> or <hi>Sinai,</hi> the Angel of the Lord appeared to him out of a burning Buſh, and called him to go to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> requiring him to deliver his people Iſrael. <hi>Moſes</hi> after he had ſhewed many ſigns and wonders in <hi>Egypt</hi> at laſt brought them out. And leading them through the red Sea, he brought them into the wilderneſs to Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where God gave them his law, and appointed <hi>Moſes</hi> to make a Tabernacle for his worſhip according to the pattern he had ſhewed him in the Mount. So that to this day for above Four hundred years, he ſhews them, the Fathers had worſhipped God without any Tabernacle at all.</p>
                  <p>He further ſhews them, that though <hi>Moſes</hi> was a perſon high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be regarded, whoſe memory ought always to be precious to them, having had intimate converſe with God, and having received the law from his mouth, yet they might remember to their humiliation how their impious Anceſtors would not obey him; but contrary to his mind, during his abſence in the Mount, made a golden Calf<note n="(c)" place="margin">

                        <hi>v.</hi> 37. And Philip ſaid, If thou believeſt with all thine heart, thou mayſt. And he anſwered, and ſaid, I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God.</p>
                     <p>38. And he commanded the chariot to ſtand ſtill: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the Eunuch, and he baptized him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 39. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch ſaw him no more: and he went on his way rejoycing.</p>

                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 14. And here he hath authority from the chief prieſts, to bind all that call on thy Name.</p>

                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 17. And Ananias went his way, and entred into the houſe, and putting his hands on him, ſaid, Brother Saul, the Lord, (even Jeſus that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto thee in the way as thou cameſt) hath ſent me, that thou mighteſt receive thy ſight, and be filled with the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 18. And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been ſcales, and he received ſight forthwith, and aroſe, and was baptized.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 22. And they ſaid, Cornelius the centurion, a juſt man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel, to ſend for thee into his houſe, and to hear words of thee.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>v.</hi> 27. And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 28. And he ſaid unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation: but God hath ſhewed me, that I ſhould not call any man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or unclean.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 29. Therefore came I unto you without gain-ſaying, aſſoon as I was ſent for. I ask therefore for what intent ye have ſent for me?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 30. And Cornelius ſaid, Four days ago I was falling until this hour, and at the ninth hour I prayed in my houſe, and behold a man ſtood before me in bright clothing,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 31. And ſaid, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the ſight of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 32. Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whoſe ſirname is Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: he is lodged in the houſe of one Simon a tanner, by the ſea-ſide, who when he cometh, ſhall ſpeak unto thee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 33. Immediately therefore I ſent to thee, and thou haſt well done, that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here preſent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 34. Then Peter opened his mouth, and ſaid, Of a truth I perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50384:48"/> them.

                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 10. Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the diſciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 11. But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhall be ſaved, even as they.</p>

                        <hi>v.</hi> 13. And after they had held their peace, James anſwered, ſaying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 19. Wherefore my ſentence is, that we trouble not them which from among the Gentiles are turned to God.</p>

                        <hi>v.</hi> 21. For Moſes of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the ſynagogues every ſabbath day.</p>

                        <hi>v.</hi> 22. Then pleaſed it the Apoſtles, and elders, with the whole church, to ſend choſen men of their own company to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas: namely, Judas ſurnamed Barſabas, and Silas, chief men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the brethren,</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 24. Foraſmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us, have troubled you with words, ſubverting your ſouls, ſaying, Ye muſt be circumciſed, and keep the law, to whom we gave no ſuch commandment:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 25. It ſeemed good unto us, being aſſembled with one accord, to ſend choſen men unto you, with our beloved Barnabas, and Paul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 26. Men that have hazarded their lives for the Name of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 29. That ye obſtain from meats offered to Idols, and from blood, and from things ſtrangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep your ſelves, ye ſhall do well. Fare ye well.</p>

                        <hi>v.</hi> 30. So when they were diſmiſſed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the Epiſtle.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 32. And Judas and Silas, being prophets alſo themſelves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 35. Paul alſo and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of the Lord, with many others alſo.</p>

                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 1. Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jeruſalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 2. And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that Goſpel, which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, leſt by any means I ſhould run, or had run in vain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 3. But neither Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumciſed:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 4. And that becauſe of falſe brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to ſpy out our liberty, which we have in Chriſt Jeſus, that they might bring us into bondage.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 6. But of theſe, who ſeemed to be ſomewhat, (whatſoever they were, it maketh no matter to me, God accepteth no mans perſon) for they who ſeemed to be ſomewhat, in conference added nothing to me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 7. But contrariwiſe, when they ſaw that the Goſpel of the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was committed unto me, as the Goſpel of the uncircumciſion was unto Peter,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 8. (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the Apoſtleſhip of the circumciſion, the ſame was mighty in me towards the Gentiles)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 9.

And though God in his infinite patience hath long born with the world, thus lying in ignorance, and going on in ſuch prodigious conceits, yet now he cauſeth his Goſpel to be preached to all Nations, and thereby calls and invites them to repentance, and to forſake their Idols and ſinful ways, which they ought ſeriouſly and ſpeedily to do, becauſe he hath appointed a day wherein he will judg the world in righteouſneſs by his Son Jeſus Chriſt, of which he hath given aſſurance by raiſing him from the dead.

But when <hi>Timothy</hi> return'd and brought him the welcom news of the firmneſs and conſtancy of their faith, and of the continuance of their charity, and of their kind remembrance of him, and great deſire to ſee him, this, he tells them, was matter of exceeding great joy unto him; and the teſtimony he heard of their faith, did more comfort him, than all the afflictions which he ſuffer'd did deject him.

He gives another reaſon, why the ſingle life is to be preferr'd before the conjugal, namely, becauſe ſingle perſons (comparatively) are more free from cares and diſtractions, and have (ordinarily) more time and lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to attend upon the Lord in religious exerciſes than the married have. For he that is <hi>unmarried,</hi> hath but one obligation of care, namely, how he may ſerve God moſt acceptably; but he that is <hi>married,</hi> hath another care on him, <hi>viz.</hi> how he may, in lawful things, pleaſe his Wife. And the like difference there is (as to this matter) between <hi>married</hi> Women and <hi>Virgins.</hi> A <hi>Wife</hi> is uſually combred with houſhold cares, and muſt, in lawful things, endeavour to pleaſe her Husband; and is not, upon that account, ſo free for holy exerciſes; but the <hi>Virgin</hi> (that has no family to care for) being freed from ſuch diſtractions, and endeavouring to approve her ſelf more eminently <hi>holy</hi> both in Soul and Body, ſhe hath more leiſure to attend on the Lord in holy and religious exerciſes. And what he ſpake concerning the advantages of a <hi>ſingle life,</hi> he ſhews, he ſpake not that he might caſt a ſnare upon them, or preciſely to bind them to abſtain from marriage, if they had not the gift of Continency, but to lead them to that which is <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>comely,</hi> that they may attend upon the Lord without diſtraction. <hi>From Ver. 25. to 36.</hi>

For our knowledg now is but imperfect, in compariſon of the knowledg of divine things, which we ſhall have in the life to come. And ſo likewiſe that gift whereby God enableth us to inſtruct others, is but imperfect, and ſhall then ceaſe, becauſe we ſhall have no further uſe of it. But when the perfect knowledg of divine things ſhall come, then our imperfect gifts which ſerved to promote knowledg in this life ſhall ceaſe. He illuſtrates this, by a twofold ſimilitude; <hi>1.</hi> By comparing <hi>this life</hi> to <hi>childhood,</hi> and the <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> to the <hi>manly ſtate,</hi> wherein childiſh things are aboliſhed. <hi>2.</hi> By ſhewing there is as great a difference betwixt our preſent knowledg in this life, and that which we ſhall have hereafter, as between one that ſeeth the image of anothers face in a Glaſs, and one that beholdeth the face it ſelf. Here we know God in his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> as in a Glaſs, by reflection; but there we ſhall know him <hi>intuitively,</hi> and immediately. And as there is a great difference between propounding a thing darkly and as a riddle, and propounding the ſame thing in plain, proper, and expreſs words. So here we ſee as by a Glaſs, or in a Riddle, but then ſhall we know God face to face, that is, clearly and perfectly. And as for himſelf, who was an Apoſtle, and had been rapt up into the third Heaven, he acknowledges he knew but in part for the preſent, but hereafter he aſſured himſelf, his mind ſhall be ſo inlightned by God, that he ſhall ſee him and know him immediately, as God now ſees and knows him, though not ſo perfectly. In Concluſion, he tells them, that in this life, theſe three emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Graces do operate in the hearts of Believers <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> Without <hi>Faith</hi> we cannot be juſtified, without <hi>Hope</hi> Faith cannot ſtand, and by <hi>Love</hi> Faith muſt be operative. But of theſe three, the greateſt is <hi>Charity. 1.</hi> In reſpect of its <hi>extent,</hi> reaching to God, good Angels, our Brethren, our Enemies. <hi>2.</hi> In reſpect of its <hi>uſe,</hi> extending to the good of <hi>others;</hi> whereas <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> are only private graces. <hi>3.</hi> In reſpect of its <hi>duration,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> ſhall ceaſe in the other life; <hi>Faith</hi> ſhall be ſwallowed up in <hi>Viſion,</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> in <hi>Fruition,</hi> but <hi>Charity</hi> ſhall abide for ever. <hi>From Ver. 8. to the end.</hi>

He affirms that theſe Precepts he hath given them are from the Lord, and commands that thoſe who eſteem themſelves Prophets, and perſons that have any ſpiritual gift or <hi>afflation,</hi> ſhould acknowledg them to be divine. And for others that affect to be ignorant, he leaves them to be ignorant at their own peril. In fine, he exhorts them, earneſtly to endeavour after the gift of Propheſying; and for the gift of Tongues, that they that have it ſhould be allowed the uſe of it, provided they obſerved the rules by him before given. And that in their publick Aſſemblies for religious worſhip, all things ſhould be performed with <hi>gravity</hi> and <hi>decency,</hi> as may moſt conduce to the glory of God, and the edification of the Church. <hi>From Ver. 34. to the end.</hi>

                     <hi>Object. 3. What ſhall become of thoſe that are alive at the Coming of Chriſt?</hi> For they are not capable of a Reſurrection who never died.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>firſt</hi> he anſwers, that 'tis as poſſible for the Body to riſe again, as for <hi>Corn ſown</hi> to be quickned after it dies in the earth.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>ſecond,</hi> he ſays, that our Bodies ſhall ariſe the <hi>ſame in ſubſtance,</hi> but not <hi>in qualities.</hi> They ſhall riſe with far more excellent qualities, than thoſe they were buried with. As a bare grain of Corn that is ſown, is raiſed in ſubſtance and kind the <hi>ſame,</hi> but <hi>diverſe</hi> in qualities, coming up with <hi>blade,</hi> and <hi>ear,</hi> and <hi>corn</hi> in it: It does not riſe in the ſame figure in which it was ſown. Seeds are ſown and <hi>rot,</hi> yet notwithſtanding they are ſo far from periſhing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that they riſe up far more beautiful; and whereas they are ſown <hi>dry</hi> and <hi>hard,</hi> they ſpring up <hi>green</hi> and <hi>freſh:</hi> So why ſhould it ſeem incredible, that our Bodies ſhould ariſe from corruption, and yet with far more excellent qualities than they had before? And as there are ſeveral kinds of <hi>fleſh,</hi> and one more excellent than another; and as <hi>celeſtial</hi> Bodies, are more glorious than <hi>terreſtrial,</hi> and one celeſtial Body differs from another in glory; ſo it will be in the Reſurrection. The Bodies that riſe, will differ from thoſe that dyed. That which was here a corruptible Body, when it riſes, will be an incorruptible. The Body that was here obnoxious, and expoſed to diſeaſes, griefs, and death, will be raiſed glorious and ſtrong, beautiful and ſhining, like unto the Stars, and the Sun in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens <hi>[Math. 13, 43. &amp; 17 2.].</hi> That which was ſown a <hi>natural</hi> or an <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> Body, which needed here to be ſupported, as other animals are, with meat, and drink, and ſuch things as afforded nouriſhment to it, ſhall be raiſed a <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Body, endued with ſpiritual qualities, not needing meat, or nouriſhment, but ſhall be ſupported immediately by the Spirit of God without means, as the Angels in Heaven are, <hi>Math. 22.30.</hi> So that there are Bodies of <hi>both theſe ſorts,</hi> which much differ one from the other. And as from the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> (according to <hi>Gen. 2.7.</hi>) we received a <hi>natural,</hi> or <hi>animal</hi> Body, which yet could not be continued in life without nouriſhment; ſo by the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we ſhall obtain a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Body in the Reſurrection, which he will ſuſtain without nouriſhment by his Spirit, He being a <hi>quickning Spirit</hi> And as ſince the Reſurrection, Chriſt hath a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Body, which is immortal and incorruptible; ſo ſhall he alſo give <hi>ſuch Bodies</hi> to thoſe that are <hi>his.</hi> Yet all things muſt be done in order; we muſt have a natural Body firſt, and a ſpiritual Body after, as that which is perfect follows upon that which is imperfect. The <hi>firſt Man</hi> is of the earth, <hi>earthly,</hi> and therefore could communicate nothing but a <hi>terrene</hi> life. But the <hi>ſecond Man,</hi> is not only <hi>man,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> from Heaven alſo, and therefore could ſupport his own Body, that it ſhould not ſee corruption (though in its own nature terrene and reſoluble into duſt); and having raiſed it out of the grave he could make it glorious, immortal, and heavenly, not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And theſe things he ſpake for his own vindication, not to reproach them: for he had ſuch an affection for them, that he could be content (if God ſaw it good) even to live and dye with them. And though he ſpake freely of their faults to themſelves, yet he gloried of them to others, and was exceedingly comforted in the midſt of all his afflictions, by the report he heard of their repentance. He ſhews, that when he was come from <hi>Epheſus</hi> into <hi>Macedonia, [Act. 20.1.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">See Sect. 13 of Ch. 6.</note>], though he met with great oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from ſome there, yet the fears he had concerning them were very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to him. But he was exceedingly comforted by the coming of <hi>Titus;</hi> and it was not his bare preſence that was ſo much a comfort to him, as the news that he brought, (with which he himſelf was alſo much comforted), <hi>viz.</hi> the news of their earneſt deſire to ſee him, their mourning for the ſins he had in his former Epiſtle charged them with, and their zeal to defend him againſt his Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niators, the falſe Teachers. And though in his former Epiſtle he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſomething ſharply to them, by reaſon of their many enormities, yet he did not now repent of it, though 'tis true he was once ſorry he had done it, leſt ſuch as were innocent among them ſhould think themſelves ſtruck-at, in thoſe his repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. But though that Epiſtle did for a while grieve them, yet now he was glad he had written it, not meerly becauſe he had grieved them, but becauſe it had brought them to a Godly ſorrow, for the evils that were among them, ſo that they received no damage at all, but much advantage thereby. For a right ſenſe and ſorrow for ſin, wrought by the Spirit of God, worketh true repentance and reformation never to be repented of; whereas worldly ſorrows, occaſion'd only by

As he told them before, ſo he tells them now, (as if he were preſent with them), that in caſe there be no amendment among them, he will make uſe of his Apoſtolick power, (which was very great and extraordinary), by which he inflicted not only ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual cenſures, but ſometimes alſo corporal puniſhments, as appears by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Bar Jeſus,</hi> whom he ſmote with blindneſs, <hi>Act. 13.11.</hi> And they did tempt him thereunto, in that they required a proof from him, whether Chriſts power did concur with his miniſtry and juriſdiction, and whether Chriſt would ratifie his cenſures, by his judgments following them. He ſhews, that Chriſt had owned him, and manifeſted his power in his miniſtry among them, by converting many of them, and beſtowing the gifts of his Spirit upon them, and by many ſigns and miracles, which he enabled him to do in the midſt of them and by his exerciſe of ſpiritual diſcipline among them. And as Chriſt appeared to be a weak and a frail man by being crucified, but was evidenced to be God omnipotent by his riſing from the dead; ſo he tells them, if they look upon him, as in himſelf, and in reſpect of the afflictions he hath been exerciſed with, he may appear a meer <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>ordinary</hi> man, and to be <hi>weak with Chriſt,</hi> and therein like and conformable to him; but yet they ſhould find, that he would ſhew a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Chriſts life and ſtrength <hi>[2 Cor. 10.3.],</hi> and that the power of Chriſt liveth in him, and doth manifeſt it ſelf in him, againſt impenitent and contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſinners. And ſince they ſeek a proof of Chriſts ſpeaking in him, (who firſt preached the Goſpel among them); he bids them look to it, and to examine themſelves, whether they be in the Faith, (that is, have a true Faith in them), and whether they be in the ſtate of true Believers, and whether Chriſt live in them by his Spirit; which they will find to be ſo, except for the preſent they are only meer counterfeit unapproved Profeſſors of Chriſtianity. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>they</hi> were, he hoped <hi>he</hi> ſhould not be found ſuch an one himſelf, but a faithful Servant of Chriſt, and a true Apoſtle. <hi>From Ver. 1. to 7.</hi>

For he paſſeth not for his own credit or reputation, how he be eſteemed, ſo their ſalvation may be promoted.

                  <p>The <hi>occaſion</hi> of this Epiſtle ſeems to be this: The Apoſtle had heard of ſome <hi>diſagreements,</hi> both in <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>affection,</hi> among the Chriſtians at <hi>Rome,</hi> who were partly <hi>believing Jews,</hi> and partly <hi>believing Gentiles.</hi> The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtians, it ſeems, mingled <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> together in the point of Juſtification; and ſo zealouſly upheld the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, and the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Rites, that they oppoſed the preaching of the Goſpel to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> except they would become <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> and ſubmit to <hi>Circumciſion:</hi> On the other ſide, the <hi>Gentile-Chriſtians</hi> underſtanding themſelves exempted from the obſervation of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Rites, uſed their Chriſtian Liberty <hi>with offence.</hi> Now to reconcile theſe controverſies, and to ſettle them, <hi>both</hi> in the truth, and in unity of judgment and affection, and to remove all emulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, the Apoſtle writes this Epiſtle.

The reaſon why this Epiſtle ſtands firſt of all the Apoſtolical Epiſtles in our Bibles, is not becauſe it was firſt written, but becauſe of the dignity of the City to which it was addreſſed, <hi>viz. Rome,</hi> the Imperial Seat.</note> the Goſpel among them at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet he held himſelf bound to contribute to the advancement of the Faith of thoſe of them, who were effectually called by Chriſt, and had obedientially ſubjected themſelves to the Goſpel. And accordingly he heartily wiſhed the abounding and increaſe of all grace, and the ſweet ſenſe of the favour and love of God to all real Chriſtians at <hi>Rome,</hi> whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And in the firſt place, that he may teſtifie his great affection to them, he declares, how heartily he gives thanks to God through Jeſus Chriſt, (in whoſe Name all prayers and thanksgiving ought to be preſented, <hi>Eph. 5.20. Col. 3.17.</hi>), that their Faith and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Goſpel, was ſo famous, and the report of it ſpread far and near, and made known in all the Churches of the whole World, and ſpoken of to their great advantage and commendation. Inſomuch that he ſolemnly profeſſes in the preſence of God, (whom he heartily and ſincerely ſerved in the Goſpel of his Son), he did not forget them in his daily prayers; but earneſtly requeſted of the Lord, that what he had ſo long deſired and deſigned, might happily, (if it ſeem'd good in his eyes), at laſt be accompliſhed, namely, that he might come perſonally unto them. For he had an extream great deſire to ſee them, not for any other reaſon, ſo much as that he might impart unto them ſome of thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual gifts which God had endued him with, and might communicate to them a further knowledg of the myſteries of the Goſpel, that they might be more eſtabliſhed and confirmed in the Faith, againſt all temptations whatſoever. Yea he deſired to ſee them, that they might be mutually comforted, by a mutual communication of the Faith, that both <hi>he</hi> and <hi>they</hi> had in Chriſt Jeſus. For it could not but greatly comfort and ſtrengthen <hi>them,</hi> to hear him diſcourſe of his Faith in Chriſt, and it would alſo revive <hi>him</hi> to hear them declare their Faith in the ſame Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus alſo; and ſo they might be mutual comforts each to other. He deſires they ſhould know that he had often purpoſed to come unto them, but ſtill by one obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle or other was hindred; and he deſired to come to them, that he might be a means of converting ſome there to the Faith, and of confirming others already converted, as among other <hi>Gentiles</hi> he had been a means of converting ſeveral, and gaining them to Chriſt. For by the nature of his office, and by the ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, he was a <hi>debter</hi> to all ſorts of men, being obliged to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to them, whether they were <hi>Greeks,</hi> thoſe of the moſt <hi>polite</hi> Nations; or <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>ruder.</hi> And as far as concerned himſelf, he was moſt ready to take a journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> to preach the Goſpel there alſo. For he was far from being aſham'd of the Goſpel of Chriſt, which is a powerful means (in the hand of God) of bringing all thoſe to Salvation, that effectually embrace it, whether they be <hi>Jews</hi> (who had the priviledg to have it firſt preached to them) or <hi>Gentiles.

For God hath made it known unto them, partly by imprinting thoſe Notions of Himſelf, and of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> in their hearts; and partly by the Book of the Creatures, in which his glorious <hi>Attributes</hi> are written in great Characters. For his inviſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Nature, and Almighty Power, are (even ever ſince the Creation of the World) clearly to be underſtood by his works which are ſeen, <hi>viz.</hi> his works of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> ſo far as to render thoſe, which do not diſcern them, nor take notice of them, <hi>inexcuſable.</hi> And ſeeing they glorified not God according to that knowledg, which the light of Nature gave them of him, nor were thankfull for his benefits; they became vain in their imaginations and reaſonings concerning God, and his worſhip, and feigned many fabulous and vain Gods unto themſelves, whereby their fooliſh heart was more and more dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned concerning the <hi>true God;</hi> and thoſe among them that ſeemed to be moſt wiſe and learned, were in thoſe matters as blind and fooliſh as others.

This he further proves, by many clear teſtimonies out of the Old Teſtament, as out of <hi>Pſal. 14.1, 2, 3. &amp; Pſal. 53 1, 2, 3.</hi> where the Prophet ſpeaking of the <hi>unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate</hi> in his time, and of all others in their natural eſtate, <hi>out of Chriſt,</hi> pronounceth, <hi>1.</hi> That <hi>no man is righteous. 2.</hi> That all are naturally <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>ignorant</hi> of the things that concern their Salvation. <hi>3.</hi> That <hi>none</hi> ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after God, to know and worſhip him as they ought. <hi>4.</hi> That they are <hi>all</hi> gone aſide from God, and from the way wherein God appointed them to walk; and being ſo corrupt by Nature they are unfit to bring forth any good fruits, or to do any good. He goes on further to demonſtrate this, from <hi>Pſal. 5.9.</hi> where from what was ſpoken of <hi>Davids</hi> enemies in <hi>particular,</hi> he proves the corruption of all mankind in <hi>general;</hi> and that becauſe (naturally) there is the ſame fountain of corruption in all. <hi>Their throat,</hi> ſays he, is like a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher newly opened, out of which comes nothing but ſtench and filthineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> murderous peſtilential threatnings; they have a falſe and deceitful <hi>tongue;</hi> their ſlanders are no leſs hurtful than the poiſon of Aſps, <hi>Pſal. 140.3.</hi> their <hi>mouth</hi> is full of curſing and bitter ſpeeches, <hi>Pſal. 10.7.</hi> they are ready to commit all manner of <hi>cruelty,</hi> and violence, and know not how to live quietly themſelves, nor to ſuffer others to be quiet, <hi>Pſal. 59.7, 8.</hi> There is no <hi>fear</hi> of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes; and ſo there is nothing to reſtrain them from running into all ſorts of wickedneſs, <hi>Pſal. 36.21.</hi> And, leſt the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould think to elude and evade the force of theſe Teſtimonies, as not belonging to them, he tells them, that what the <hi>Law,</hi> that is, the <hi>books of the Old Teſtament,</hi> the <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> thus ſay, they ſay <hi>to</hi> and <hi>of</hi> the <hi>Jews;</hi> and by complaining ſo

                     </note>, was the true way for a ſinner to become righteous; which righteouſneſs <hi>Abraham</hi> had obtained whilſt he was uncircumciſed, to the end, that he might be the <hi>Father</hi> (in a ſpiritual ſenſe) of <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (that were uncircumciſed), and the <hi>Father</hi> of thoſe that believe among the <hi>Jews</hi> (who were circumciſed), namely, to as many of them, as (beſides their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion) imitated his Faith.

Now (ſays he) if they <hi>that are of the Law,</hi> that is, that ſeek to be juſtified by the works of the Law, be heirs of this promiſed inheritance, then <hi>the way of Faith</hi> preſcribed by God, is to no purpoſe. And if it could be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that God had promiſed to conveigh the inheritance to them who performed
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50384:126"/> perfect obedience to the Law, that Promiſe would not avail them, ſeeing no man is able to perform perfect legal righteouſneſs. And 'tis evident, that the Law is ſo far from juſtifying, and ſo giving a <hi>title</hi> to the Inheritance, that it <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wrath,</hi> that is, it reveals and pronounces condemnation, and death, upon the guilty for their tranſgreſſions: not that of it ſelf, it was originally deſtin'd to ſubject men to puniſhment, but by <hi>accident</hi> and <hi>occaſionally</hi> in reſpect of mans diſobedience, it doth inevitably adjudg him thereunto. Whereas were there no Law written in <hi>nature,</hi> or <hi>given by God,</hi> there would be no tranſgreſſion, and ſo no Condemnation. The Law therefore is ſo far from juſtifying, that it condemns. Seeing then, that neither Juſtification, nor the promiſed Inheritance, (which typified Heaven), is obtained by the <hi>works of the Law,</hi> it follows, that it muſt needs be obtain'd by <hi>Faith.</hi> And God hath appointed it to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by Faith, that it might be of free and undeſerved <hi>grace</hi> and favour; and to be of grace, that His promiſe might ſtand firm and ſure to all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (whereas it would be unſure and uncertain, if it depended on the condition of performing perfect obedience to the Law), and not to them <hi>only,</hi> who are his Seed according to the fleſh, (to whom the Law was given), but to them alſo which imitate his Faith, (though they be <hi>Gentiles</hi>); for he is the Father of all that believe, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles.

He ſhews, that for ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly perſons as theſe, Chriſt in the fulneſs of time came to dye.

                  </p>
                  <p>He further purſues this Argument, by ſhewing, that the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not leſs effectual to ſave thoſe that by Faith are united to him, than <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was to deſtroy thoſe who naturally deſcend from him. This he proves by comparing Chriſt and <hi>Adam</hi> together, and ſhewing their <hi>ſimilitude</hi> and <hi>diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude; 1.</hi> As by <hi>Adam ſin</hi> entred into the world, and <hi>death</hi> by ſin, upon all that are his Children by nature; ſo by Chriſt <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> came into the world, and by righteouſneſs <hi>life,</hi> unto all that are ſpiritually born of him. For, before the giving of the Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſin was in the world, and was imputed, as may appear by this, that Death (which is the wages of ſin) reigned over In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, that had not ſinned actually as <hi>Adam</hi> had done. Therefore, beſides the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> which Infants could not tranſgreſs, there was <hi>another Law</hi> which God had given to the <hi>firſt man,</hi> the tranſgreſſion whereof was imputed to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50384:127"/> all his poſterity, yea even unto Infants. And this <hi>firſt man</hi> (he ſhews) was a <hi>type</hi> or <hi>figure</hi> of him that was to come, <hi>viz.</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus. For as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was the <hi>fountain, head,</hi> or root of ſin and miſery, ſo Chriſt is the fountain and head of righteouſneſs and life. And having thus ſhewed, wherein they agreed, he comes now to ſhew, wherein they differ: And that he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts by theſe poſitions. <hi>1.</hi> The ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> is not ſo pernicious, as the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt (which is freely given) is beneficial. For if the offence of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> brought forth <hi>death</hi> to all that are naturally propagated of him, much more ſhall the free grace of God convey <hi>life</hi> to all thoſe who are in Chriſt by Faith, and born of him after the Spirit. <hi>2.</hi> Though from <hi>Adams</hi> ſinning, the guilt of his <hi>one offence</hi> redounds to the condemnation of many, yet the <hi>free gift</hi> of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> redounds to the juſtification of many, not only from the guilt of that <hi>firſt ſin,</hi> but of all other actual ſins alſo. <hi>3.</hi> As by one offence death reigned over all mankind, much more ſhall they, who by Faith are united to Chriſt, and ſo participate of his abundant grace, and the free gift of his righteouſneſs, be made partakers of everlaſting life, wherein they ſhall reign with Him in glory.

                  </p>
                  <p>Having ſhewed how this Doctrine tends to promote holineſs, he comes now to exhort thoſe who are <hi>juſtified by Faith,</hi> to endeavour to be holy, and to take care that <hi>ſin</hi> get not any dominion over them, and that they obey it not by yeilding to the ſinful luſts, inclinations, and motions of the fleſh, nor employ the faculties and powers of their ſouls, or the members of their bodies in the ſervice of ſin and the Devil, but in the ſervice of God, who hath ſo graciouſly rais'd them by the power of his grace from the death of ſin, and endowed them with the life of righteouſneſs through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus. And he tells them, that if they did contend and ſtrive duly againſt ſin, it ſhould not have dominion over them, becauſe they are not under the Law as a <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> exacting perfect obedience, and miniſtring no ſtrength to perform it; but under a Covenant of grace in Chriſt, which miniſters ſtrength to reſiſt ſin, and to overcome it. Yet none ought to infer from hence, that becauſe they are not under the Law as a <hi>Covenant,</hi> therefore they are not under it as a <hi>rule;</hi> or that becauſe they are under the Covenant of grace, therefore they may indulge themſelves in ſin, ſeeing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary plainly follows thereupon. For ſtanding in the relation of ſervants to God, they muſt not ſerve ſin; for they muſt of neceſſity be the ſervants to him whom they obey, and muſt receive a reward proportionable to the work they do. If they be the ſervants of ſin<note n="(e)" place="margin">Servi eſtis cui obeditis, ſive peccati (quod ducit) ad mortem ſive obedientiae (quae ducit) ad ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiam:</note>, it will bring upon them eternal death; if they be the ſervants of obedience, that is, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſervants to God, it will bring them the reward of righteouſneſs, which is <hi>eternal life.</hi> Indeed before their converſion, he acknowledges, they did ſerve ſin, but (through the grace of God) the time of that bondage was paſt, and now they had begun ſincerely to obey that <hi>form of ſound Doctrine,</hi> into which they were led by <hi>them,</hi> that firſt preached the Goſpel unto them<note n="(f)" place="margin">In quam traducti eſtis ab iis qui Evangelium vobis annunciarunt. <hi>Vatablus.</hi> vide etiam <hi>Piſc.</hi> in loc. vide 2 Tim. 1.13.</note>. Therefore being made free from the <hi>ſlavery of ſin,</hi> they were now become ſervants to <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> He tells them, he ſpeaks plainly to them in an earthly ſimilitude (becauſe of the weakneſs of their underſtandings in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50384:128"/> matters, <hi>Joh. 3.12.</hi>), and accordingly declares unto them, that is was but equal, that as before they had obeyed ſin, and yeilded up their members to be ſervants to uncleanneſs and iniquity, even to the acting of all unrighteouſneſs; ſo now they ſhould yeild their members to be ſervants to righteouſneſs, that they may attain to a high degree of ſanctification. As therefore when they ſerved ſin they were void of righteouſneſs, (<hi>that</hi> had no whit of their ſervice), ſo now it is but equal, that ſeeing they are ſervants of righteouſneſs, they ſhould be free from ſin, and not ſervants at all unto it. Laſtly, he minds them of the ſad na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>ſervice</hi> of ſin, it being for the time paſt <hi>unprofitable,</hi> for the time preſent <hi>ſhameful,</hi> and for the time to come <hi>deadly.</hi> But they that have gain'd liberty from the bondage of ſin, and are become ſervants unto God, he ſhews, have great benefit thereby. For they will daily grow more and more in grace and holineſs, and at laſt ſhall obtain eternal life. So that the <hi>wages, due reward,</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of ſin, is death; but <hi>life eternal</hi> is the <hi>end</hi> of righteouſneſs; not as its <hi>wages,</hi> but as a <hi>gift</hi> freely given by God, upon the account of the merit and interceſſion of Chriſt. <hi>From Ver. 12. to the end.</hi>

For the power of the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit of Chriſt, (which rules in the hearts of <hi>Believers</hi> as a Law, dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them what they ought to do), frees <hi>them</hi> and <hi>himſelf</hi> in particular, from the reigning power of ſin, the wages whereof is death: From neither of which the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was able to reſcue any man.

What therefore the <hi>Law</hi> cannot do by reaſon of mans firſt tranſgreſſion thereof, and his preſent pravity of nature, God was pleas'd to do, by ſending his Son (who took on him our true human nature, yet not a ſinful nature, though he had the likeneſs of it, in being ſubject to our infirmities), to be made a Sacrifice for us on the Croſs, and there he condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſin in the fleſh of his Son, and did exact of him the pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For thoſe that are in their corrupt and natural eſtate do ſavour only fleſhly things, which lead and bring a man to death, but they that are regenerate do ſavour ſpiritual things, which lead to everlaſting life and peace. For the wiſdom of the fleſh, or the carnal mind, is enmity againſt God, there being a natural repugnancy in it to ſubmit it ſelf to his will. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that are in their carnal and corrupt eſtate, and follow the luſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence of the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God till they be converted and changed. <hi>From Ver. 1. to 9.</hi>

For <hi>Moſes</hi> when he commended the Law to the people, <hi>Deut. 30.11,</hi> &amp;c. ſpake in this wiſe; <hi>This is the commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It is not in heaven, that thou ſhouldſt ſay, who ſhall go up for us to heaven, and bring it down unto us, that we may hear it and do it. Neither is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſea, that thou ſhould ſay, who ſhall go over the ſea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may know it and obey it: but the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth,</hi> (that is, thou canſt not plead ignorance, for this word is fully declar'd to thee, and thou haſt it daily in thy mouth) <hi>and in thy heart,</hi> (thou underſtandeſt ſufficiently what the Lord requires of thee), that thou mayeſt do it. It remains therefore, that thou take care fully and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to perform it. For the man that doth all things preſcribed in the Law <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly</hi> and <hi>perfectly,</hi> without ever failing in any one particular, ſhall <hi>live</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: And on theſe, and no other terms doth the <hi>Law</hi> promiſe eternal life, which now are not poſſible to be perform'd by any meer man ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall. But as for the <hi>Goſpel</hi> which preſents juſtification by Faith, he tells them, that if he may bring it in ſpeaking, in alluſion to <hi>Moſes,</hi> they ſhould find it would ſpeak in this wiſe: <hi>Say not in thine heart,</hi> (nor give way to any ſuch vile thoughts), <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into heaven</hi> to bring the <hi>Meſſias</hi> down from thence, that we may believe in him and obey him? For he is already come from heaven, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exhibited and offered to thee, and if thou wilt be ſaved, 'tis neceſſary thou believe that this Jeſus is the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſent of God; and not only ſo, but that being crucified here by wicked men, and put to death, and laid in the grave, he roſe again the third day, and aſcended to the right hand of his Father, there to intercede for us. And ſay not thou in thy heart, <hi>Who ſhall deſcend into the deep,</hi> (that is, into the grave), to bring Chriſt again from the dead? For as he died for the ſins of men, ſo he is aſſuredly riſen again for their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.

The <hi>Jews</hi> therefore being deſcended from thoſe holy Patriarchs, to whom and their ſeed the Covenant is made, <hi>[I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed],</hi> have ſtill a relation to that Covenant made with their Fathers; and ſo their caſe is not deſperate. And the ſame is the ſenſe of the other ſimilitude. As the <hi>branches</hi> follow the nature of the <hi>root,</hi> ſo do the <hi>Jews</hi> the condition of thoſe holy Patriarchs, in regard of the outward priviledges of the Covenant; that is, not in reſpect of <hi>perſonal</hi> and <hi>inherent,</hi> but <hi>faederal</hi> and <hi>external</hi> holineſs, ſo as they may expect to be owned by God as his viſible Church. <hi>From Ver. 11, to 17.</hi>

                  <p>But here ſome <hi>Gentile</hi> might object, We acknowledg the <hi>root</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:50384:136"/> Nation to be holy, but what good doth the holineſs of the root to theſe incredulous branches, that are now broken off, and rejected of God? The Apoſtle anſwers, That ſome of the branches are indeed broken off from the ſweet <hi>Olive-tree,</hi> (that is, from the Church of the holy Patriarchs); and the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that are as a wild Olive, and not ſprung from that holy root, are by Faith grafted in among the branches that remain in the ſweet Olive, and ſo imitating the Faith of the holy Patriarchs, are made <hi>one Church</hi> with them, and thereby partake of the root and fatneſs of the <hi>ſweet Olive,</hi> that is, of the Doctrine and grace of Chriſt, and all the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual benefits and priviledges which he conferreth on his Church. But yet ſeeing the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are, of <hi>meer grace,</hi> grafted in, (being before in a forlorn condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion), they ſhould not diſdainfully boaſt, or inſult over the branches that are broken off, <hi>viz.</hi> the incredulous <hi>Jews;</hi> for they are <hi>natural</hi> branches of that body and root, which bears the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and have an outward fellowſhip with the Olive; that is, they are the natural Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who <hi>in ſome degree</hi> is deſpiſed, when his Children are deſpiſed; ſo that if they inſult over theſe branches, they do in a manner lift up themſelves againſt the root, which bore theſe branches, even againſt <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, who is call'd the root of this Olive-tree, in reſpect, that he is the Parent from which the <hi>Jews</hi> naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, and in reſpect of the Covenant that God made with him. And further, they ſhould conſider, that this root doth bear the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and not <hi>they</hi> the root. The Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> is our <hi>Mother-Church; Salvation is of the Jews,</hi> as our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Joh. 4.22.</hi> The <hi>Gentiles</hi> are not called to make a <hi>ſeveral</hi> Church by themſelves; neither do they ſo: For there is but <hi>one Church;</hi> but they are called to be members of the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh. 10.16. I have other ſheep which are not yet of this fold,</hi> (that is, the Elect among the <hi>Gentiles), them I muſt bring into this fold, that there may be one fold,</hi> (or Church), <hi>and one ſhepherd.</hi> But the Chriſtian <hi>Gentile</hi> might here again object, that though the <hi>Jew</hi> be the <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Olive,</hi> and the <hi>Gentile</hi> the <hi>wild Olive;</hi> yet the <hi>Jews</hi> are broken off, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might be grafted in. He anſwers, The proper cauſe of the breaking off of the <hi>Jews,</hi> was their infidelity, and not the coming in of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> for they came in by accident; and the proper cauſe of the coming in, and the preſent ſtanding of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is their <hi>Faith:</hi> Therefore they ſhould not be high-minded, but fear, and accordingly look to their ſtanding. And as a man that is on the top of a tree brags not of his height, but looks to his hold, ſo ought they. For if God ſpared not the natural branches, but proceeded with ſo much ſeverity againſt his own people the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have no reaſon to expect leſs ſeverity, if they take not heed to themſelves. Two things therefore he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates in this matter, are eſpecially to be conſidered by them. <hi>1.</hi> The ſeverity of God againſt the incredulous <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom Chriſt was a ſtone of ſtumbling. <hi>2.</hi> His infinite mercy and grace, in effectually calling the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to Faith in Chriſt, in which they are to continue<note n="(l)" place="margin">

So likewiſe the <hi>Jews,</hi> if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue not in their unbelief, ſhall be grafted in again; for God is able to do it. Yea he ſhews, the thing is not only poſſible, but very probable, becauſe God hath grafted in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that are branches of the wild Olive; and 'tis <hi>contrary to nature,</hi> to graft a wild Olive branch into a right Olive; but <hi>natural,</hi> to graft into it one of its own kind. If therefore he hath grafted in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> 'tis much more likely he will re-ingraft the <hi>Jews,</hi> that are the natural branches, (naturally deſcended of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and the holy <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> with whom he made his Covenant), into their own Olive tree, from which they were cut off for their unbelief. <hi>From Ver. 17, to 25.</hi>

                  <p>Having thus ſhewed the <hi>poſſibility</hi> and <hi>probability</hi> of the Calling of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he now comes to ſhew, the <hi>certainty</hi> of it; and takes his argument from the revelation of this <hi>myſtery</hi> or <hi>ſecret</hi> made to himſelf by the Spirit of God, which he was to impart to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And accordingly tells them, he would not have them ignorant of it, Leſt they ſhould be tempted, proudly to deſpiſe the <hi>Jews</hi> as utter <hi>caſt-aways.</hi> For he acquaints them, that <hi>blindneſs</hi> and <hi>obduration</hi> is not come upon the <hi>Jews</hi> univerſally, but on <hi>ſome</hi> of them only, and that for a certain time; namely, till a greater number of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> than ever before, ſhall be brought to believe in Chriſt, and ſo enter into the true Church; with the coming in of which great multitude, the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be provoked to turn to Chriſt; and ſo all <hi>Iſrael;</hi> that is, the <hi>generality</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhall be brought to embrace Chriſt, and thereby be put into a way of ſalvation. When therefore the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is come in, there ſhall be a famous and univerſal calling of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And this he ſhews, is agreeable to the Propheſie, <hi>Iſa. 59.20, 21.</hi> where the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> reſpecting the time of the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> ſaith, <hi>The deliverer (viz.</hi> the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who was typified by <hi>Cyrus) ſhall come to Sion;</hi> but the Apoſtle looking further, even to thoſe things that were to follow the coming of Chriſt, by way of <hi>accommodation,</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Redeemer ſhall come out of Sion,</hi> that is, out of the midſt of his Church, where he dwelleth and abideth by his Spirit, and <hi>ſhall effectually call the Jews.</hi> The Prophet indeed ſays, <hi>He ſhall come to them, that return from iniquity in Jacob.</hi> But the Apoſtle (following the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> which was underſtood by the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) ſaith, <hi>he ſhall turn iniquity from Jacob;</hi> and ſo inſtead of mentioning Chriſts coming, he ſpeaketh of a <hi>benefit</hi> that ſhould <hi>follow his Coming,</hi> which is, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin. Now where God forgives ſin, he firſt gives the grace of true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be converted. And he further ſhews, that this is Gods <hi>Covenant,</hi> which he will fulfill unto them, namely, to <hi>pardon their ſins,</hi> and they that ſhall have their ſins pardoned, ſhall be firſt effectually called, and ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall reap the <hi>benefit</hi> of the Covenant, when they ſhall feel the <hi>efficacy</hi> of it, turning their hearts to God, and perſwading them to embrace Jeſus Chriſt by Faith. <hi>From Ver. 25, to 28.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome might here object, What! ſhall the <hi>Jews</hi> be called and pardoned, that are Gods enemies, whom he hates for rejecting the Goſpel? He anſwers, They are <hi>enemies,</hi> and yet <hi>beloved</hi> in divers reſpects. If we reſpect the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> they are Gods enemies, and hated by him; namely, becauſe they refuſe and perſecute it, ſpurn and kick againſt it; and do the more perſecute and hate it for the <hi>Gentiles ſake,</hi> becauſe they ſee them love and embrace it, and that thereupon they are admitted into the Church. But if we reſpect Gods <hi>election of this people,</hi> above all other Nations, to be his <hi>peculiar</hi> people, and how they are deſcended of thoſe holy Patriarchs, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> (with whom the Lord entred into Covenant, and promiſed to be <hi>their God,</hi> and <hi>the God of their ſeed after them</hi>); in this <hi>regard</hi> they are <hi>beloved</hi> of God.

                  <p>His laſt argument for the <hi>general calling</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> is this; God after a long time of diſobedience received the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to mercy; therefore there is reaſon to think, that he will at laſt receive the <hi>Jews</hi> alſo. For (according to the rule), <hi>Of like things there is the ſame judgment to be made.</hi> Now the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were formerly diſobedient, have obtained mercy, by occaſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> infidelity and obſtinacy; God ſending the Goſpel to them which the <hi>Jews</hi> rejected.

                  <p>THE Apoſtle had ſoon a notable experience of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious protection over him, promiſed unto him in that forementioned Viſion.

And they came to the chief Prieſts and Elders being confident of their aſſiſtance, and acquainted them with what they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on, and perſwaded them to intreat the <hi>Colonel,</hi> that he would bring <hi>Paul</hi> down on the morrow to them, that they might further examine him, and by the way, before he could come at the Council, they reſolv'd to kill him. This conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, by the wonderful providence of God, coming to the knowledg of a <hi>Nephew</hi> of <hi>Pauls,</hi> he is by him acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, who thereupon deſired one of the Captains of the Guard, to bring that <hi>young man</hi> to <hi>Lyſias</hi> their chief Commander: which being done he acquainted him with this wicked conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the life of his Uncle. Hereupon the <hi>Colonel</hi> preſently gave order that a Guard both of Horſe and Foot ſhould be made ready againſt Nine of the Clock that night, and a Horſe or Mule provided for <hi>Paul</hi> to ride on, and that they ſhould convey him ſafe to <hi>Felix</hi> the <hi>Procurator</hi> or <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Judea,</hi> under the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, who had his ordinary reſidence at <hi>Caeſarea.</hi> And he wrote a Letter to the Governour concerning the Priſoner, to this ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That he found nothing brought againſt him, that was puniſhable either with <hi>death</hi> or <hi>bonds</hi> by
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50384:151"/> the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, and Imperial Conſtitutions; (for the <hi>Romans</hi> had not as yet ſet out any decrees againſt the Chriſtians) and therefore he had reſcued him out of the hands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had treacherouſly conſpired againſt his life, and had given or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his accuſers to appear before <hi>his Excellency,</hi> and there to implead him. <hi>Felix</hi> when he had read the Letter, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be ſecured in the Hall call'd <hi>Herods Hall,</hi> and wen his Accuſers were come, he ſaid, he would hear him.</p>

                        <hi>v.</hi> 17. Then Paul called one of the Centurions unto him, and ſaid, Bring this young man unto the chief Captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.</p>

The Apoſtle perceiving that the Governour inclin'd to ſend him to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (which courſe might have expos'd him to extreme hazzards), he tells him, that he was his priſoner, and that <hi>his Excellency</hi> was his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Judg;</hi> under the <hi>Roman Emperor,</hi> and not the <hi>Jews,</hi> (whom he had not wronged), and therefore it would be a piece of high injuſtice, to deliver him up to his enemies to be his Judges. Moreover, he tells him, that he was a <hi>Roman,</hi> and therefore might claim the priviledg of a <hi>Roman,</hi> which accordingly he

                  <p>SOME days after, <hi>King Agrippa,</hi> (Son of that <hi>Herod</hi> who ſlew <hi>James, Act.</hi> 12. who was King, not of <hi>Judea,</hi> but ſome neighbouring Province which the <hi>Romans</hi> had given him), and <hi>Bernice</hi> his Siſter, came to <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> to ſalute the new Governour. <hi>Feſtus</hi> relates to them <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe, and acquaints them, how vehemently the <hi>Jews</hi> accuſed him, and how earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they deſired to have had judgment againſt him. But he told them, he could not do it by the <hi>Roman Laws,</hi> without firſt hearing the cauſe, and bringing the <hi>accuſers</hi> and <hi>accuſed</hi> face to face. This therefore he had done, and upon hearing of both parties, He found <hi>Paul</hi> abſolutely free from all capital Crimes; and the differences between him, and the <hi>Jews,</hi> he ſaw, were about matters appertaining to <hi>their Religion,</hi> (which he contemptuouſly calls Superſtition), in which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, he himſelf h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d little skill, and therefore had a mind to have referr'd him to the <hi>Jewiſh Sanhedrim,</hi> to be judged there. But the Priſoner declin'd their judgment, and <hi>appealed to Caeſar.</hi> Whereupon he had remanded him to Priſon, till he could conveniently ſend him to the Emperor at <hi>Rome. Agrippa</hi> (who was born and bred among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and in probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty underſtood ſomething concerning the Chriſtian Religion) hearing this, deſired that he himſelf might ſee <hi>Paul,</hi> and hear him ſpeak for himſelf. <hi>Feſtus</hi> readily agrees hereunto. On the morrow therefore, the Governour, with <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>Bernice,</hi> and ſeveral other perſons of quality, entred the Court and place of hearing <hi>with great pomp;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> was brought forth before them. <hi>Feſtus</hi> having made a ſhort ſpeech, wherein he ſhewed the occaſion of their meeting, and wherefore he had brought forth the Priſoner before that illuſtrious Aſſembly. <hi>Agrippa</hi> told him he was permitted to ſpeak for himſelf. Then <hi>Paul</hi> beckning with his hand to the ſtanders by to hold their peace, and give Audience, he particularly addreſſes his ſpeech to <hi>Agrippa</hi>
                     <note n="(a)" place="margin">Quis non delectetur concionator, concionem habere propter ſpem lucrandi Magnates mundi, quorum converſio multum poteſt ad lucrandos caeteros.

                  <p>Then he removes an Objection which might be made againſt him, <hi>viz.</hi> If he were brought up a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> how came he to <hi>believe in Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> and to hope for a Reſurrection by him. Surely the <hi>Phariſees</hi> never taught him ſo. To this he anſwers, He was once as great and ſharp an Adverſary to Chriſt, and all that believed in him, as any man whatſoever; and thought himſelf bound in Conſcience to endeavour the ſuppreſſion of all thoſe that owned him; which accordingly he did, being a principal Actor in the impriſoning of ſeveral of them at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And when ſome of them were by the <hi>Jews,</hi> tumultuouſly condemned to die, (as particularly <hi>Steven, Act. ch.</hi> 7.57, 58.), he was an approver of the ſentence, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.1. And in other Cities beſides <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he brought them into the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Courts, and Conſiſtories, (which were kept in their Synagogues), and with threatnings and tortures compelled them to deny Chriſt, and (being exceedingly fierce againſt them) he forced ſome of them to fly to <hi>heathen Cities,</hi> and then purſued them thither alſo. He further declares, that as he was going to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> with authority from the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> on this perſecuting deſign, at mid-day a light from Heaven, above the brightneſs of the Sun, ſhone round about him, and thoſe that were with him; and when they were all fallen proſtrate on the Earth, he heard a voice ſpeaking to him in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue; <hi>Saul, Saul, why doſt thou thus perſecute me? 'Tis hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks.

                        <hi>v.</hi> 25. But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himſelf hath appealed to Auguſtus, I have determined to ſend him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 26. Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my Lord: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have brought him forth before you, and ſpecially before thee, O King Agrippa, that after examination had, I might have ſomewhat to write.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 27. For it ſeemeth to me unreaſonable, to ſend a priſoner, and not withall to ſignifie the crimes laid againſt him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 26. <hi>v.</hi> 1. Then Agrippa ſaid unto Paul, Thou art permitted to ſpeak for thy ſelf. Then Paul ſtretched forth the hand, and anſwered for himſelf:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 2. I think my ſelf happy, King Agrippa, becauſe I ſhall anſwer for my ſelf this day before thee, touching all the things whereof I am accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the Jews:</p>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:50384:156"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 3. Eſpecially, becauſe I know thee to be expert in all cuſtoms and queſtions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beſeech thee to hear me patiently.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 4. My manner of life from my youth, which was at the firſt among mine own Nation at Jeruſalem, know all the Jews,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 5. Which knew me from the beginning, (if they would teſtifie), that after the moſt ſtraiteſt ſect of our religion, I lived a Phariſee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 6. And now I ſtand, and am judged for the hope of the promiſe made of God unto our fathers:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 7. Unto which promiſe our twelve Tribes inſtantly ſerving God day and night, hope to come: for which hope ſake, king Agrippa, I am accuſed of the Jews.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 8. Why ſhould it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God ſhould raiſe the dead?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 9. I verily thought with my ſelf, that I ought to do many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Name of Jeſus of Nazareth:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 10. Which thing I alſo did in Jeruſalem, and many of the ſaints did I ſhut up in prison; having received authority from the chief prieſts: and when they were put to death, I gave my voice againſt them:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 11. And I puniſhed them oft in every ſynagogue, and compelled them to blaſpheme, and being exceedingly mad againſt them, I perſecuted them even unto ſtrange Cities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 12. Whereupon, as I went to Damaſcus with authority and commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the chief prieſts,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 13. At midday, O king, I ſaw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightneſs of the ſun, ſhining round about me, and them which journeyed with me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 14. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto me, and ſaying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteſt thou me? It is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 15. And I ſaid, Who art thou, Lord? And he ſaid, I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 16. But ariſe, and ſtand upon thy feet, for I have appeared unto thee for this purpoſe, to make thee a miniſter and a witneſs, both of theſe things which thou haſt ſeen, and of thoſe things in the which I will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto thee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 17. Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I ſend thee,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 18. To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and inheritance among them which are ſanctified by faith that is in me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 19. Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not diſobedient unto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly viſion:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 20. But ſhewed firſt unto them of Damaſcus, and Jeruſalem, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout all the coaſts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they ſhould repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 21. For theſe cauſes the Jews caught me in the Temple, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to kill me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 22. Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witneſſing both to ſmall and great, ſaying none other things than thoſe which the prophets and Moſes did ſay ſhould come:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 23. That Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, and that he ſhould be the firſt that ſhould riſe from the dead, and ſhould ſhew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>v</hi> 24. And as he thus ſpake for himſelf, Feſtus ſaid with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beſide thy ſelf, much learning do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 26. For the king knoweth of theſe things, before whom alſo I ſpeak freely: for I am perſwaded that none of theſe things are hidden from him, for this thing was not done in a corner.</p>
                     <p>

But then (he tells them) they muſt ask in <hi>Faith,</hi> and with a fixed dependance on God, not wavering, or doubting either concerning his power, goodneſs, or faithfulneſs. For <hi>doubting</hi> or <hi>wavering</hi> keeps men in a perpetual diſquiet, and agitation of mind, not knowing what to depend on. Beſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And he further tells them, that 'tis not only in prayer, that this fluctuation, or wavering of ſpirit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces ſuch ill effects; but he ſhews them, that ſuch a perſon hath the infelicity of never knowing in other occaſions, where to fix or what courſe to take. And having given them this caution concerning <hi>prayer,</hi> he returns to his purpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, of comforting the afflicted under their trials. And in order hereunto, he counſels the <hi>poor Chriſtian,</hi> who is through afflictions or the Croſs, humbled by the Lord, and brought low, to comfort himſelf, yea to glory in <hi>this,</hi> that he is exalted to the high dignity of being an adopted Child of God. And the <hi>rich man</hi> he counſels, not to rejoice in his <hi>riches;</hi> but if God have given him an humble frame of mind, and a preparedneſs to bear the Croſs, and to be brought low, to <hi>rejoice</hi> in that frame of ſpirit. For all his glory (as he is a rich man) is very fading. As the Sun when it is riſen ſcorcheth the green graſs, and maketh the florid part of it preſently to wither; ſo a <hi>rich man</hi> (when God permits it) ſoon fadeth in his eſtate, and cometh to nothing, notwithſtanding all his counſels and endeavours to the contrary. He concludes this admonition, declaring <hi>that Chriſtian to be bleſſed,</hi> who patiently endureth the afflictions which he ſhall meet with in the way of his duty; for when he ſhall be tryed, and found faithful, he ſhall at length obtain the crown of eternal life, which the Lord hath graciouſly promiſed to them that love him, and that teſtifie their love to him, by a patient enduring tribulations for his ſake. <hi>From Ver. 1, to 13.</hi>

For the <hi>Law, Lev. 19.15.</hi> (to which place 'tis probable he pointeth), ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no unrighteouſneſs in judgment: Thou ſhalt not reſpect the perſon of the poor, nor the perſon of the mighty; but in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhalt thou judg thy neighbour.</hi> But here they might object <hi>this,</hi> that which he reprov'd in them was a <hi>ſmall offence,</hi> and might be eaſily excus'd, and their obedience in other things might make amends for ſuch a ſmall failing as this was. To this he anſwers, that, Suppoſe a man ſhould be an exact ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of all other points of the Law (which yet is impoſſible) and willingly offend in one particular, he is guilty of breaking the whole Law. Not that <hi>all ſins</hi> concurr in <hi>one,</hi> but becauſe a contempt of the ſame Law and Law-giver is manifeſted in the breach of one Command as well as of all. For obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods will is required <hi>univerſally</hi> to all that he commands, and he that offends in one command, though he keep all the reſt, fails of the obedience which is due from him, and ſo is puniſhable as well as if he had offended in all. And that he may make this matter the more clear, he inſtances in the <hi>Sixth</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Commandments,</hi> ſhewing that in the violation of either, the authority of the <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> and of him that commanded <hi>both,</hi> is violated. But they might again object, that they ſhall not ultimately be judged by the Law, as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Moſes,</hi> (which requires perfect obedience in every reſpect, and pronounces a Curſe upon every one that in the leaſt tranſgreſſeth), but by the Goſpel, <hi>[ſee ch. 1.25.].</hi> He anſwers, that he would have them ſo <hi>ſpeak,</hi> and <hi>act,</hi> and carry themſelves in thoſe matters, as thoſe that ſhall be judged by the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is a Law of <hi>Liberty</hi> indeed, but not of <hi>licentiouſneſs;</hi> of liberty from ſin, but not of liberty to ſin. And if they would not come under the rigour of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they muſt not be cruel and injurious to their poor Brethren. For the equity of that Law requireth, that thoſe perſons ſhould find no mercy, who will

And he was the more ſollicitous concerning them, becauſe though he was abſent from them in the body, yet he was preſent with them <hi>in Spirit,</hi> that is, not in bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit or phantaſie or affection only, but <hi>ſo</hi> as he was well acquainted with their ſtate, and had knowledg of their affairs (either through the information of <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras,</hi> or through extraordinary revelation, <hi>ſee 2 King. 5.26.</hi>), and rejoiced exceedingly to ſee and behold, in the apprehenſion and viſion of his mind, the good order and government of their Church, and the ſtedfaſtneſs of their Faith in Chriſt, which he would gladly have them continue in.

                     <hi>6.</hi> He begins here by a Figure call'd <hi>Hyſteroſis,</hi> to oppoſe himſelf againſt the third ſort of errors, which he had caution'd them againſt, <hi>v. 8.</hi> namely, urging the <hi>Moſaical Rites,</hi> and Elements of the former Ages of the World, as neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, He anſwers an Objection which he foreſaw the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> might make againſt what he had before ſaid. He had ſaid, <hi>v. 10. Believers were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in Chriſt.</hi> But poſſibly they might ſay, That ſome <hi>Teachers</hi> among them taught them, That they, being <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and wanting <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and ſo not perfect in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle anſwers, that they, being <hi>Believers,</hi> and united to Chriſt, need not be <hi>outwardly Circumciſed;</hi> for they had <hi>by him,</hi> the thing ſignified by Circumciſion, namely, the <hi>ſpiritual Circumciſion of the heart,</hi> which conſiſts in cutting off, and putting away the body of manifold ſins, form'd, and compacted of our innate corruption, whereof particular ſins are the members. And the means of this their renovation is <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> (which ſucceeds in the place of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion), and which (as it was anciently adminiſtred to adult and grown perſons) was a clear repreſentation of the <hi>death, burial,</hi> and <hi>reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt, and by proportion repreſented alſo how Chriſtians ought to dye unto ſin, and riſe unto newneſs of life. Which <hi>new life</hi> they live by <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>that Faith,</hi> God who raiſed Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, works in them by his own
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:50384:177"/> Spirit. He uſes alſo another Argument againſt the neceſſity of Circumciſion, namely, that when they, in the time of their natural ſtate and condition, were dead in ſins, and without Circumciſion in their Fleſh, (as being <hi>Gentiles, Eph. 2.11.</hi>), God had quickned them, as he did Chriſt, infuſing into them the new life of grace, and giving them a right to the life of Glory, having pardoned all their ſins, both <hi>original</hi> and <hi>actual,</hi> freely for his ſake, upon their belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in him. Yea Chriſt hath by his death, blotted out, and aboliſhed the <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of the Ordinances,</hi> and thoſe Legal Ceremonial Injunctions, touching Circumciſion, and the obſervation of <hi>Days,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Waſhings,</hi> and <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Eph. 2.15.</hi> in the obſervance of which, the <hi>Jews</hi> teſtified againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their own guiltineſs and liableneſs to puniſhment. For, by killing a Beaſt they teſtified they deſerved to dye themſelves. But now Chriſt, having by his death ſatisfied the Juſtice of God for our ſins, hath thereby can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd thoſe Ordinances<note n="(d)" place="margin">Chirographum <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

Now ſeeing the debt is paid, and the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to wrath which we were under, (by reaſon of our ſins), cancell'd, to revoke this hand-writing of ordinances, (which teſtified ſo much againſt us), and to ſeek to bring it in force again, as <hi>falſe Teachers</hi> labour'd to do, (by urging Circumciſion, and the Legal Obſervances), muſt needs be, not only a great folly, but very pernicious. Nay further, Chriſt by his death hath not only cancell'd this hand-writing that was againſt us, and taken it out of the way, and nailed to his Croſs, but thereby alſo hath vanquiſht, and diſarm'd <hi>his</hi> and <hi>our enemies,</hi> the Devil, and all the powers of Hell, and hath carried them, as it were, in triumph, and made a ſhew of them openly, making them a ſpectacle of ſhame and ſcorn in the eyes of God and good Angels, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals us'd in their Triumphs to have their Captives carried diſarm'd, and bound, after their Triumphal Charriots. <hi>From Ver. 8, to 16.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He draws now a Concluſion from the former Argument, namely, That ſeeing the <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> was aboliſhed, therefore none ſhould preſume to condemn them, or lay ſin to their charge, for uſing any of the <hi>Meats</hi> or <hi>Drinks</hi> prohibited by <hi>that Law,</hi> or for not obſerving the <hi>Jewiſh Feſtivals,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For theſe things were but ſhaddows<note n="(e)" place="margin">Ceremoniae fuerunt umbra rerum futurarum, cujus umbrae cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, h. e. complementum adumbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, eſt <hi>Christus.</hi>
                     </note> of good things to come, and were to remain only untill the coming of Chriſt, who is the <hi>truth, body,</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of them. Some of them pointed at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Sanctity, this Chriſt in his own perſon clearly taught and perfectly fulfill'd; ſome pointed at the expiation of ſin, and this Chriſt truly wrought by his <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience; ſome preſignified that eternal Reſt which true Believers ſhall partake of hereafter. 'Tis not imaginable, that thoſe <hi>Seducers,</hi> the Apoſtle here bends himſelf againſt, ever pleaded for or ſtrove to maintain the Chriſtian-Sabbath, the firſt day of the week. Therefore 'tis not probable, that in oppoſing them, he ſhould implead that day. Beſides, the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,</hi> here mentioned, were a ſhadow of things to come, whereas the <hi>Lords day</hi> is a memorial of ſome thing paſt, namely, the glorious Reſurrection of Chriſt. The old <hi>Seventh day Sabbath</hi> might ſhaddow out ſomething of Chriſt; and the <hi>Ancients</hi> generally underſtood it, to ſhaddow out his Reſt <hi>that day</hi> in the grave<note n="*" place="margin">Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of the Chriſtian-Sabbath, ſee Knowl. and Practiſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 256.</note>. So that the Apoſtles Argument runs thus, Seeing the Ceremonial Ordinances were but ſhaddows and repreſentations of good things to come, and to laſt only till Chriſt came; to obſerve them now under the Goſpel, is in effect to ſay, That Chriſt the <hi>body,</hi> or <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is not yet come. <hi>Ver. 16, 16.</hi>

                  <p>Having preſs'd them to endeavour after unity, by an argument taken from thoſe many things wherein the Church and all the true members thereof agree; he now anſwers an objection which he foreſaw ſome would be apt to make againſt what he had ſaid. They would object, That though there be <hi>many things</hi> wherein the Church and all the true members thereof <hi>agree;</hi> yet there are <hi>many things</hi> alſo wherein they differ. To this he anſwers, that the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of gifts and graces,</hi> and <hi>their divers meaſures,</hi> beſtowed by Chriſt upon the ſeveral members of the Church, do all tend to <hi>unity,</hi> ſeeing they all come from <hi>one</hi> and the ſame <hi>Author,</hi> and are all given for the promoting <hi>one</hi> and <hi>the ſame End.</hi> This he proves out of <hi>Pſal. 62.18.</hi> where <hi>David</hi> by a prophetical ſpirit ſpeaking of <hi>things to come</hi> as already <hi>paſt,</hi> foretels that Chriſt ſhould in a triumphant manner, aſcend up on high, that is, to the higheſt Heavens, and ſhould lead <hi>captivity captive;</hi> that is, as he had upon the <hi>Croſs</hi> foiled all the ſpiritual enemies of his Church and people, and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:50384:183"/> begun to triumph over them; ſo in <hi>his aſcenſion</hi> he ſhould continue the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph [ſee <hi>Judg. 5.12.</hi>] as Conquerors us'd to do. And as <hi>they</hi> us'd to ſcatter the ſpoils, and other rich gifts, among the applauding-Citizens and Soldiers, ſo ſhould Chriſt <hi>at his aſcenſion</hi> pour forth and diſtribute a large meaſure of the Gifts and Graces of his Spirit unto his Church, and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral members thereof: which <hi>Prophecy</hi> the Apoſtle ſhews was now fulfilled by Chriſt. He further declares, That Chriſt <hi>aſcending</hi> to Heaven by his own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power, did preſuppoſe his foregoing humiliation and abaſement, in all the degrees of it, even his deſcending to the <hi>lower parts of the earth;</hi> which <hi>expreſſion</hi> is to be underſtood, not by comparing the <hi>parts</hi> of the earth among themſelves, but by comparing <hi>Earth</hi> with <hi>Heaven,</hi> the Earth being the loweſt part of the World. And particularly, it either pointeth out his <hi>conception</hi> in the womb of the Virgin [ſee <hi>Pſal. 139.15.</hi>], or his <hi>burial</hi> [expreſſed by a like phraſe, <hi>Mat. 12.40.</hi>], with all the other ſteps of his humiliation inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening. So that the <hi>Perſon</hi> who thus deſcended to take on him our humane nature, with the ſenſleſs infirmities thereof, is the <hi>ſame</hi> alſo who aſcended to the higheſt Heavens, the ſeat of Majeſty and Glory, far above all the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Heavens,</hi> and that for <hi>this end,</hi> That he might <hi>fulfil</hi> all <hi>prophecies</hi> and <hi>predictions</hi> concerning himſelf (whereof this of <hi>David</hi> was one), and all thoſe parts of his <hi>Mediatory Office</hi> which were yet to be perform'd in Heaven; and particularly, that he might <hi>fill</hi> and adorn all the members of his Church with the Gifts and Graces of his Spirit.

And upon this account the Wife ought to practiſe this duty of ſubmiſſion, becauſe her Husband's power and authority over h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r, is for her good. For his dominion is not to be <hi>tyrannical</hi> or <hi>rigorous,</hi> but <hi>loving, gentle,</hi> and <hi>amiable;</hi> and ſuch as the Wife may look upon as a <hi>mercy</hi> to her ſelf, as well as a <hi>dignity</hi> to her Husband. And as Chriſt is the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church for <hi>its good,</hi> ſo the <hi>Husband</hi> is appointed the head of the Wife <hi>for her good</hi> and <hi>benefit.</hi> As therefore all that are <hi>regenerate,</hi> and <hi>true members</hi> of the Church, do willingly ſubject themſelves to Chriſt; ſo he ſhews 'tis fit that <hi>Wives</hi> ſhould be ſubject to their own Husbands <hi>in every thing</hi> that is lawful and honeſt. In the next place he comes to the duty of <hi>Husbands;</hi> exhorting them, Not to abuſe that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority which God hath given them over their Wives, by a <hi>domineering, harſh,</hi> or <hi>bitter</hi> carriage [ſee <hi>Col. 3.18.</hi>]; but inſtead thereof, to <hi>love</hi> them with a <hi>ſpecial</hi> and <hi>conjugal love,</hi> ſuch as no other muſt ſhare in. This he inforces from Chriſt's example, who loved his Church not in <hi>words</hi> only, but in <hi>deeds;</hi> teſtifying the greatneſs of his love, by giving himſelf for it [ſee <hi>v. 2.</hi> of this <hi>chap.</hi>], that he might tranſlate it from a ſtate of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> to a ſtate of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>life;</hi> that he might regenerate and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie it, that he might cleanſe it, and do away the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſin cleaving to believers, <hi>by juſtifying their perſons [Rom. 8.1.];</hi> and the <hi>filth,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>activity</hi> of ſin, by the renovation of their natures. And the external means by which be effecteth all this, are, <hi>1. Baptiſm,</hi> call'd here, the <hi>waſhing of water.</hi> And, <hi>2. The Miniſtry of his word.</hi> And his end in thus cleanſing and ſanctifying his Church in this life, is, That it may be holy, not having blemiſh, ſpot, or deformity (that is, exempt from blame and reprehenſion); when it ſhall be preſented to himſelf, as the Bride to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, for the ſolemn conſummation of the begun-marriage, <hi>Rev. 19.7.</hi> And according to this example, Husbands ought to love their Wives even as their own bodies, For there is ſo near a union between them, that he that loves his Wife, loves himſelf. 'Tis therefore as unnatural for a man, not to love his Wife, as to hate his own fleſh; which all men are ſo far from doing, that they nouriſh and cheriſh it, and do all things imaginable for its preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And after the ſame manner does Chriſt alſo nouriſh and cheriſh his Church, and provide all things neceſſary for it, becauſe his Church is as nearly join'd to him, as <hi>Eve</hi> was to <hi>Adam,</hi> of whom (being made of a rib taken out of his ſide with fleſh on it) he ſaid, <hi>Gen. 2.23.

                  <p>The occaſion of this Epiſtle ſeems to be this.

Firſt, The <hi>Aaronical High-Prieſt</hi> being taken from among men, and ſevered and ſet apart from the common multitude, was appointed to act and negotiate for the good of men, in the things wherein they have to do with God; particularly, to offer <hi>gifts, oblations,</hi> and <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> for their ſins. <hi>2.</hi> He was to execute this his Office with pity and compaſſion<note n="(a)" place="margin">

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:50384:193"/> only. Now the Apoſtle ſhews, that all theſe may well be applied to Chriſt. And firſt, he inſtances in the <hi>laſt</hi> of them, That Chriſt did not intrude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon this Office, nor aſſumed the honour and glory of it to himſelf, but the Father glorified him by ordaining him thereunto. And this he proves from two places in the <hi>Pſalms: 1.</hi> Out of <hi>Pſal. 2,</hi> where God the Father ſays to him, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee;</hi> that is, in this day of thy reſurrection I have beſtowed this ſpecial dignity upon thee, to be a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>High-Prieſt;</hi> and thou ſhalt aſcend into Heaven, as the High-Prieſt did into the Holy of Holies; and then he commands him, <hi>to ask of him the ends of the earth,</hi> or to intercede for the ſalvation of many, which is a ſpecial part of his Prieſtly Function. His ſecond proof is out of <hi>Pſal. 110,</hi> where God's deputing Chriſt to that Function is declared. For 'tis God the Father that ſaith, <hi>Thou art ſuch a Prieſt as Melchiſedec</hi> was; that is, a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prieſt together;</hi> and thy Prieſthood ſhall never ceaſe, or be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by any, till this <hi>Mediatory</hi> Kingdom of thine ſhall be delivered up to me, See <hi>2 Cor. 15.24.</hi> The Apoſtle having thus proved that Chriſt was called to be a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> he proceeds to ſhew, that the other things which belonged to the High-Prieſt, belonged unto him. For, <hi>2.</hi> He was a Son of man, of the ſame nature and<note n="(b)" place="margin">He aſſumed our Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being like to us in infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that were not ſinful.</note> mould with us. <hi>3.</hi> He offered a ſacrifice for the ſins of the people (but not for his own, for he had none), and that ſacrifice was, <hi>Himſelf on the Croſs. 4.</hi> He was a merciful High-Prieſt, having had experience of our miſeries.

And though he were the <hi>beloved Son of God,</hi> and ſo more excellent than any High-Prieſt, yea, than any Creature; yet by his grievous ſufferings he was inured to ſubmit to his Father's will; and experimentally knew what <hi>Obedience</hi> meant, and how hard a leſſon <hi>Patience</hi> under the Croſs is (which is the higheſt and chiefeſt point of a Chriſtian's obedience); and thereby he became more fit to compaſſionate us. Yet it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, that ſo excellent a Perſon, and ſo dear to God, ſhould ſuffer as he did: for by his ſufferings he was made a full and perfect Redeemer <hi>Heb. 7.26.],</hi> ſo that nothing more need be added unto what he has done and ſuffered for the redemption of man.

                  <p>The Apoſtle having ſet forth <hi>Melchizedec</hi>'s excellency in himſelf, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to amplifie the ſame in reference to others. And firſt, ſheweth how he ought to be preferred before <hi>Abraham,</hi> and before all the <hi>Levites</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Abraham.</hi> For that act of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s in giving a <hi>tenth</hi> to <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> implieth an inferiority in himſelf who paid them, and a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority in him that received them; becauſe the <hi>Tenth</hi> was an holy tribute due to God, and ſo it was paid by <hi>Abraham,</hi> who paid it to <hi>Melchizedec</hi> as to God's Prieſt, ſtanding in God's room, and in that reſpect greater than himſelf. 'Tis true, he ſhews that the Levitical Prieſts had commiſſion by the Law to receive Tythes of all Jews that defended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were counted greater than their Brethren. But <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> who was no kin to <hi>Abraham</hi> (nor of that people), but a ſtranger to him, received Tythes, not from the Progeny of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but from <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf; which is a greater dignity than to receive them only from his own people. <hi>2.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſhews, that to bleſs <hi>authoritatively,</hi> is an act of ſuperiority; now <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedec</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was ſo ſpecial a <hi>Favourite</hi> of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch excellent promiſes from him, and had them ſo often repeated to him.

For in thoſe moſt <hi>ſolemn</hi> Sacrifices offered upon their <hi>annual day of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> [Lev. <hi>16.21.</hi>], they were to make a ſolemn acknowledgment and confeſſion<note n="*" place="margin">We Chriſtians alſo make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of our ſins year by year, yea, remember the ſins of our youth, and deprecate the wrath they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, but not by offering a <hi>new Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> as they did, whereby they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, that no ſacrifice formerly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered was ſufficient to expiate ſin, or cleanſe the conſcience.

And 'tis plain, that God was never pleas'd with the <hi>Levitical</hi> Sacrifices for their own ſake, but only as they ſignified the death of his Son, Therefore in the fulneſs of time (when God ſaw it fit) Chriſt came into the world to do <hi>that</hi> which the <hi>Levitical</hi> Sacrifices did only prefigure, but could not effectuate.

Again, there was this difference between the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſts, and Chriſt: They were <hi>many,</hi> and miniſtred as Servants, repeating daily and frequently the ſame ſacrifices (for kind) which God had enjoin'd; none of which had power, of themſelves, to free the Conſcience from guilt, or the offendor from the puniſhment due to ſin. But Chriſt did not always ſtand miniſtring and offering ſacrifices, as they did; but having once offered up himſelf on the Croſs (which one Sacrifice ſufficeth for ſin for ever), he ceaſed and offered no more, but aſcended into heaven, and there ſitteth at the right hand of his Father, and there continueth to execute his <hi>Kingly</hi> and <hi>Prieſtly Office,</hi> till all the enemies of our ſalvation, and at laſt Death it ſelf, ſhall be vanquiſhed; and then He ſhall lay down this form of governing, and with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt be <hi>all in all</hi> for ever; ſee <hi>1 Cor. 15.24,</hi> &amp;c. And he ſhews, it needs not be wondred at, that Chriſt hath now no more offerings to make, nor ſufferings to endure; for by that <hi>one offering</hi> of himſelf, he hath made a perfect ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God, and a full purchaſe of all things<note n="*" place="margin">See Heb. 7.25.</note> that were requiſite and needful, to bring thoſe to eternal life who are <hi>ſanctified</hi> by his grace, and brought to believe in him with a lively faith. He hath not left any other Offering to be made for them, after His. And he further proves the abſolate perfection of Chriſt's Sacrifice, by the teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt, recorded <hi>Jer. 31.31.</hi> where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God bad promiſed a <hi>new Covenant</hi> inſtead of the <hi>old,</hi> and had ſaid, <hi>This is the Covenant I will make with them after thoſe days (viz.</hi> when the days of the Old Teſtament are exſpir'd); then He ſays, <hi>I will put my Law into their hearts, and their ſins and iniquities I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member no more.</hi> Now ſeeing God promiſeth under the <hi>new</hi> Covenant, <hi>ſanctification</hi> and <hi>remiſſion of ſins</hi> to all true believers (of which Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Chriſt is the Mediator<note n="*" place="margin">See Chap. 8.6. Chap. 9.16.</note>, by whoſe death it is confirm'd); therefore his one Sacrifice once offered up, is abundantly ſufficient. And if remiſſion of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:50384:201"/> ſins be obtained by Chriſt's <hi>one</hi> Sacrifice, there needs no repetition of it, nor any other offering for ſin. <hi>From Ver. 5, to 19.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto the Apoſtle hath <hi>doctrinally</hi> inform'd the <hi>Chriſtian-Hebrews,</hi> that the <hi>Goſpel-Miniſtry</hi> under the New Teſtament (ordained by Jeſus Chriſt, God-man, our great Prophet and High-Prieſt), far excelleth the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Miniſtry</hi> under the Old Teſtament. He comes now <hi>practically</hi> to exhort them to divers Chriſtian duties, which by way of <hi>application</hi> he inferrs from his precedent Doctrine, eſpecially from the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> of Chriſt. And firſt, He exhorts them conſtantly to hold faſt their profeſſion of <hi>faith in Chriſt. 2.</hi> To be very careful that their converſation be correſpondent to the Precepts of the Goſpel. In his Exhortation, he uſeth ſome arguments taken from the <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Types;</hi> which he ſo lays down, that withal they may tend to raiſe the minds of the believing-Hebrews to conſider the excellency of the things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thereby.

For ſuch perſons, he tells them, there remains no other ſacrifice for ſin, nor other way of remiſſion, nor any other means to help them; But, having <hi>knowingly</hi> and <hi>wilfully</hi> rejected Chriſt, and <hi>maliciouſly</hi> betaken themſelves to the ſide of his Adverſaries, there remains nothing for them but a dreadful expectation of the fiery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of God, which ſhall devour all ſuch enemies of His.

And he further tells them, that 'tis good and profitable for them, that their hearts ſhould be eſtabliſhed with the true doctrine of the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> of God to us in Chriſt (which gives true reſt and quiet to the conſcience), and not think that the mingling the obſervation of ſome of the legal ceremonies (as the diſtinction of meats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) with the Goſpel, is the right way to get peace and eſtabliſhment.

                  </p>
                  <p>Another argument whereby he preſſes the ſtudy of holineſs, is, becauſe <hi>the end of all things was at hand;</hi> that is, the end of the <hi>Jewiſh State</hi> and <hi>Polity.</hi> For that great fatal deſtruction threatned to the obdurate <hi>Jews,</hi> and often mentioned by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, drew nigh; ſee <hi>Mat. 24. Jam. 5.3, 9.</hi> Therefore he exhorts them, <hi>1.</hi> To be ſober, and moderate, and to be much in prayer with God; and to add to their prayers watchfulneſs, that <hi>that day</hi> do not ſurprize them unawares. <hi>2.</hi> He preſſeth them to exerciſe a <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent love</hi> and charity one towards another, as the <hi>ſum</hi> and chief of all the duties we owe to our Neighbour: For <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> he tells them, will cover a multitude of ſins and failings among Chriſtians <hi>[Prov. 10.12.],</hi> and will hide them from the knowledg of the prophane. <hi>3.</hi> They ſhould be cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hoſpitable to their poor brethren, without grudging or murmuring at the charge. <hi>4.</hi> They ſhould endeavour rightly to employ their ſpiritual gifts for the good of others, which they had received according to their reſpective places in the Church, as counting themſelves ſtewards of thoſe various gifts beſtowed on them through the free grace and favour of God. He inſtances in two, <hi>1. Preaching of the word;</hi> ſhewing, that he that teacheth and inſtructeth the people, ought to do it with that uprightneſs and reverence, as becomes one that is a ſteward or diſpenſer of the Oracles of God. <hi>2. Miniſtration to the poor;</hi> which office the Deacons were faithfully to diſcharge; and private Chriſtians were alſo to exerciſe their liberality according to the ability God had given them; that in the right uſe of all theſe gifts, God might receive glory (both by the <hi>Steward</hi> and <hi>diſpenſer</hi> of them, and by thoſe alſo who are <hi>profited</hi> by them) through Jeſus Chriſt, in whoſe <hi>ſtrength</hi> only theſe gifts are rightly employed <hi>[Joh. 15.5.],</hi> and through whoſe merits and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, the <hi>intention</hi> to glorifie God by them is accepted <hi>[Heb. 13.5.];</hi> to whom, as to God bleſſed for ever, all honour and dominion ought for ever to be aſcribed. <hi>From Ver. 7, to 12.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, he exhorts them not to be troubled or amazed at the ſharpeſt perſecutions or hotteſt trials they ſhould meet with for the ſake of Chriſt. For conſidering that in <hi>that furnace</hi> their graces will be tried, and their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions purged away, they ſhould count it matter of joy to them, becauſe hereby they are made partakers of the afflictions appointed for the members of Chriſt, and are made like unto him in ſuffering, and ſhall ſhare with him in his glory, and have matter of incomparable exultation and joy at his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In the mean time, if they be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, and for their Chriſtian profeſſion, they ſhould eſteem it the happieſt thing that could befall them. For the glorious <hi>Spirit</hi> of God delighteth with his comfortable and ſupporting-operations, to reſide in the hearts of ſuch as ſuffer for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſake; which bleſſed Spirit, though he be blaſphemed by perſecutors, yet he is glorified by thoſe who boldly confeſs the truth, which he teacheth and imparts unto them. But he adviſes them by all means to be careful, that not any of them ſuffer as an <hi>evil-doer</hi> in any kind; but if he ſuffer for Chriſt's ſake, or becauſe he is a Chriſtian, he ſhews that he ought to rejoyce in it, and to glorifie God, who hath made him <hi>willing,</hi> and hath enabled him to ſuffer in ſo good a cauſe, and hath thereby honoured him with a certain degree of Martyrdom. He tells them, the time is at hand when the Chriſtians muſt expect great ſufferings. <hi>Judgment</hi> will begin at the Houſe and Family of God, for the correction and trial of his own children.

                  <p>AND now we can trace this great Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> no further by any light the Scripture hath left us. Some learned men indeed hold, that (the <hi>two years</hi> being ended in which he was detained in Military cuſtody, and taught the Doctrine of Chriſt at <hi>Rome</hi>) he preached the Goſpel up and down in <hi>Italy;</hi> and from thence went into <hi>Spain</hi> and the Weſtern parts. And ſome hold, that he went into <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> where for five or ſix years he confirmed and eſtabliſhed the Churches he had before planted in thoſe Countreys, and then returned to <hi>Rome</hi> again; where, on the 29 of <hi>June,</hi> in the 13 year of <hi>Nero,</hi> he was beheaded. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in his 26 <hi>Hom.</hi> on 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> ſays, The day of his death was more certainly known than that of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great.

Indeed he mentions in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ch. 15.24, his deſire and intent to go and preach in <hi>Spain.</hi> But it ſeems he ſaw cauſe to change his reſolution. For it appears that when he wrote his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> he intended very ſhortly (if <hi>Timothy</hi> came to him from <hi>Epheſus</hi>) to go for <hi>Judea,</hi> Heb. 13.23; yea, to go to <hi>Philippi</hi> [Phil. <hi>ch.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 24.] and to <hi>Coloſs</hi> [Philem. v. 22.]. Poſſibly the <hi>apostacy</hi> and <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering</hi> he heard of in the <hi>Eaſtern Churches,</hi> cauſed him to think it more needful to go thither, than to go <hi>Weſtward.</hi> He expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted indeed <hi>Timothy</hi> to come to him again to <hi>Rome;</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ever met and travelled together again, or what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther became of either of them, we cannot from any thing the Scripture hath left us, certainly determine.</p>

For <hi>ſuch a love</hi> of the world, and <hi>the true love</hi> of God, are inconſiſtent; becauſe the <hi>one</hi> promotes corruption and ſin, and the <hi>other</hi> ſanctification and holineſs. And you ſhould conſider, that <hi>all the things</hi> that are in the world (which

                  <p>The <hi>Prodigies</hi> related by <hi>Joſephus</hi> were theſe: Not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Warr, on the day of <hi>

In the ſame <hi>Feast</hi> alſo a <hi>Cow</hi> that was led to ſacrifice, brought forth a <hi>Lamb</hi> in the middle of the Court of the Temple. The Eaſt gate of the Temple, which was Braſs, and mighty heavy, and could ſcarce be ſhut with twenty men, and at evening was lock'd up, and barr'd with barrs of Iron, was ſeen (about ſix of the clock at night) to open of its own accord. On the 21 of <hi>May,</hi> before Sun-ſet, were ſeen in the air <hi>Iron Chariots,</hi> and Armies in battel-array paſſing along in the Clouds, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitting the City. And in the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> the Prieſts going into the inner Temple, according to cuſtom, to celebrate the Worſhip of God, at firſt they found the place to move, and heard a noiſe; and afterwards they heard a voice, which ſaid, <hi>Let us depart hence.</hi> A Blazing-ſtar in faſhion of a Sword, hung over the City for a year together: See <hi>Har. of the Four Evangeliſts,</hi> chap. 5. p. 168. And thus much of the <hi>Prodigies</hi> that preceded the Warr. I come now to ſhew the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Occaſion</hi> of the Warr that brought that fatal ruin and deſtruction upon the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:50384:235"/> was this: <hi>Florus</hi> being ſent by <hi>Nero</hi> to ſucceed <hi>Albinus</hi> in the <hi>Procuratorſhip of Judea,</hi> being a vile and wicked perſon, outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly abuſed his Authority, and by all manner of Rapines and Inſolencies vex'd and oppreſſed the <hi>Jews;</hi> inſomuch, that by a <hi>publick Cryer</hi> he gave leave to <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>High way-men</hi> to rob and ſpoil throughout the whole Countrey, provided he himſelf might have part and ſhare of the booty. The <hi>Jews</hi> not able to endure theſe Outrages, ſome of them abandoned their houſes, and fled to ſtrange Countreys. Others of them (being of themſelves forward enough to revolt) were yet greatly provoked thereunto by the daily oppreſſions of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> who endeavoured to drive them to it, that his great and intolerable Oppreſſions and Villanies might be leſſened by their Revolt. Another thing alſo that much diſpos'd them thereunto, was this: There was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy<note n="*" place="margin">

But the <hi>Jews</hi> applying it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, revolted; and ſo Chriſt's blood lying upon them, and crying for vengeance, they themſelves haſtened that vengeance by their own Madneſs. The Warr began in the <hi>Twelfth year of Nero,</hi> in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> who was then in <hi>Grecia,</hi> and ſtayed there till Winter.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Agrippa</hi> (who had under his government <hi>Galilee, Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, Tarichea, Julias</hi> beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> with the neighbouring-Villages, and <hi>Chaleis</hi>), in a long Oration dehorts the <hi>Jews</hi> from warr, but in vain.

At <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> alſo, <hi>Eleazer</hi> the ſon of <hi>Ananias</hi> the High-Prieſt, and Commander of the Soldiers of the Temple (a bold and factious young man) perſwaded the Prieſts that they ſhould not offer any more the Sacrifices that were wont to be offered for <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and the welfare of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Which raſh act, the Governours of the City (that were peaceable men) plainly ſaw tended to open rebellion. Whereupon, not being able to perſwade the <hi>Seditious</hi> from this courſe, they ſent Meſſengers to <hi>Florus</hi> at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and to King <hi>Agrippa;</hi> deſiring them; that they would preſently ſend Forces and ſuppreſs the Rebellion in the beginning. <hi>Florus,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired there ſhould be a Revolt, neglected it.

Between theſe two parties there were continual skirmiſhes for ſeven days together. After ſome ado the <hi>Rebels</hi> brake into the upper Quarters, burnt divers Palaces and publick Houſes, and then beſieged the Caſtle

After this, they lay ſiege to the King's Palace, which they took and burnt; and upon the very <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> put to death the <hi>Romans</hi> who (after the Palace was won by aſſault) had retired into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of <hi>Hippico, Phaſaelus,</hi> and <hi>Mariamne;</hi> where, being beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and yeelding upon compoſition, and delivering their arms, yet contrary to all faith they were put to death.</p>

At this time many <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> (ſuborned by the <hi>Seditious</hi>) flattered the multitude with expectation of aſſiſtance from God; and therefore though <hi>Titus</hi> often exhorted them to yeeld, yet they flatly refuſed. The <hi>Romans</hi> now preſſing hard towards the Temple, the Conteſt was earneſt on both ſides. After a long skirmiſh, the <hi>Romans</hi> breaking in by <hi>Antonia,</hi> ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon the North and Weſt Porches of the outward Range of the Temple; part of which Porches (eſpecially that which was join'd to <hi>Antonia</hi>) was burnt and overthrown by the <hi>Jews;</hi> and two days after, the other part was burnt by the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Jews being ſo amaz'd, that they endeavour'd not to quench it. <hi>Titus</hi> had an intention to have ſav'd the Temple; but on the tenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> a certain Soldier <hi>without</hi> any command (nay, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> the command of his General), moved as by inſtinct from above, caſt a flaming fire-brand into the Chambers and Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the North-ſide of the Temple, which immediately taking fire, burnt the Temple alſo which joined to them, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that <hi>Titus</hi> could do to prevent it. And this happened on the ſame day of the ſame Month on which the former Temple was ſet on fire by the command of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Temple thus burning, <hi>Titus</hi> was ſaluted Emperor by his Soldiers, and the <hi>Zelots</hi> and <hi>Seditious</hi> fled into the Upper City call'd <hi>Sion.</hi> They now deſire a parley with the <hi>General</hi> himſelf, who check'd them for their obſtinacy, but promiſed them life if they would yeeld to him. They being unwilling to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to his Mercy, requir'd to depart the City with their wives and children, and to go into the Wilderneſs.

                     <hi>Titus</hi> being enraged at theſe Propoſals, threatens them with ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſtruction, and forthwith commands all the lower City to be ſet on fire. Then he began to aſſault the Higher City, which was ſeated on a ſteep Rock. And beginning to raiſe his Mounts on the 20th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and perfecting them on the 7th of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> he brings his Engines to the Walls, wherein having made a breach, the <hi>Seditious</hi> through fear and amazement deſerted their ſtrong Towers, and ſo on the 8th of <hi>September</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> brake in and deſtroyed all with fire and ſword. <hi>Titus</hi> now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands both the City and Temple to be utterly razed to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and to be laid plain, and a <hi>Plough to be brought over it,</hi> according to cuſtom, which was done by <hi>Turnus Rufus;</hi> and ſo the Propheſie was fulfilled, <hi>Zion ſhall be plowed as a field,</hi> Mic. 3.12. Only the Weſt part of the Wall, with three Towers, for their ſtrength and beauty were preſerved, to bear witneſs of the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the City to poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Of thoſe which during the whole Warr were taken Captives, the number amounted to 97000: and of thoſe that periſhed in the ſiege, to 1100000. So heavy was the guilt that lay on them for the death of Chriſt, and ſo horrid were the enormities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by them, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays, <hi>If the Romans had delayed to come againſt them,</hi> he thought <hi>the City would either have been ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of the earth, or have periſhed by Thunder-bolts and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from Heaven, and ſo have ſuffered like Sodom;</hi> the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants whereof they exceeded in wickedneſs.

                  <p>And thus fell this famous City on the 8th day of <hi>September,</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> He and <hi>Titus</hi> his Son being <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls,</hi> 38 years after the death of Chriſt, whoſe blood cried for vengeance againſt theſe obdurate Jews.</p>
                  <p>That this diſmal deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is ſet out <hi>Mat.</hi> 24, as the deſtruction of the whole World, need not ſeem ſtrange if we conſider, that it was the deſtroying of the Lord's own <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,</hi> and the <hi>place</hi> choſen by Himſelf above all the places in the world, to put His Name there, and the deſtroying of the State and Polity of the Jews, who were his <hi>old peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> A people once higheſt in his favour, now deepeſt in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: formerly the people of his higheſt dignations; but now their caſting off was ſealed by the ruin of their <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> their diſperſion and ſcattering abroad among other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their great obduration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Titus</hi> having thus ended the Warr, returns to <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Antiochia</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> and then into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thence ſails to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was welcomed home by all men, and (together with his Father) triumphed for the Conqueſt of <hi>Judea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The two Captains of the <hi>Seditious, John</hi> and <hi>Simon,</hi> who had hid themſelves, were taken, and reſerved to be led in triumph, and 700 other Jews that excelled in beauty and ſtrength; of all whom only <hi>Simon</hi> ſuffered death. The <hi>LAW</hi> alſo of the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:50384:239"/> Jews was carried in this Triumph as the <hi>laſt of the ſpoils,</hi> which together with the <hi>Purple Veils</hi> of the Sanctuary, were laid up in the Palace.</p>
                  <p>From this Victory both <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> got the Name of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror;</hi> yet neither of them had the Title of <hi>Judaicus,</hi> although many other Honours, eſpecially <hi>Triumphal Arches,</hi> were decreed unto them.</p>
                  <p>A year after, <hi>Lucilius Baſſus</hi> was ſent Lieutenant into <hi>Judea,</hi> who receiving the Army from <hi>Cerealis Vitellianus,</hi> took the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Herodian</hi> and <hi>Macharua</hi> beyond <hi>Jordan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not long after, <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> wrote to <hi>Tiberius Maximus</hi> to <hi>ſell all the Land of the Jews;</hi> upon whom, whereſoever they lived, he impoſed a yearly Tribute to be paid into the <hi>Capitol,</hi> viz. the <hi>Didrachma</hi> or half Shekel, it being that they were wont to pay in former times unto the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A year after, <hi>Publius</hi> ſucceeds <hi>Baſſus,</hi> and finiſhes the Warr, taking the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Maſſada</hi> from <hi>Eleazar,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Judas Galilaeus</hi> the Captain of the Thieves. All the Thieves in the Caſtle (to the number of 900, with their Wives and Children) at the perſwaſion of <hi>Eleazar,</hi> ſet fire on the Caſtle, and the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture thereof, and then put each other to death, leſt they ſhould fall into the power of the <hi>Romans.</hi> And ſo the Warr in <hi>Judea</hi> ended.</p>
                  <p>Many of the Thieves that eſcaped from <hi>Judea,</hi> fled into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and there they ſollicited the Jews to revolt; but the common people taking 600 of them, delivered them up to the <hi>Romans</hi> to be puniſhed. <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> having notice of theſe things, commands <hi>Lupus</hi> the Governour of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that he ſhould pull down the <hi>Jewiſh Temple</hi> that was there built long ago by <hi>Onias</hi> the Brother of the High-Prieſt; which he neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do, but only ſpoiled it of ſome of its Conſecrated things, and ſo ſhut it up. But <hi>Paulinus,</hi> his Succeſſor, having ſpoiled it of all its gifts, made an Order that none ſhould preſume to come to it; and ſo he put an end to the exerciſe of the Jewiſh Religion there, 343 years (as ſome compute) after that Temple was firſt built by <hi>Onias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A certain Jew, a Weaver, <hi>Jonathan</hi> by name, eſcaping to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene,</hi> drew 2000 Jews to follow him into the Wilderneſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to ſhew them <hi>ſigns</hi> and <hi>wonders;</hi> but by the chiefeſt of the Jews the matter being diſcovered to <hi>Catullus,</hi> Governour of thoſe parts, he ſent Soldiers, who ſlew moſt of them; and not long after, <hi>Jonathan</hi> himſelf was taken, who accuſed the moſt wealthy of the Jews (unjuſtly) to have had a hand in this Inſurrection. To whoſe accuſations <hi>Catullus</hi> willingly giving ear, put 3000 of them to the ſword. And this he did with the greater confidence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he confiſcated their Eſtates to <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s uſe. <hi>Jonathan</hi> he ſent priſoner (with others that were taken) to <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> that he might accuſe the moſt honeſt of thoſe Jews that lived at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> as if they had held correſpondence with him; yea, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, That <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Writer of the Jewiſh Hiſtory, ſent to him
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:50384:240"/> both Arms and Money. But <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> looking upon this as a falſe accuſation, upon <hi>Titus</hi>'s entreaty acquitted theſe men, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly puniſhed <hi>Jonathan,</hi> whom having whipped, he burnt alive. <hi>Catullus</hi> at preſent eſcaped through the mildneſs of the Emperor; but not long after, fell into grievous anguiſh of mind, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he ſaw the Ghoſts of thoſe men he had ſo unjuſtly ſlain before his eyes. At laſt his <hi>guts</hi> and <hi>bowels</hi> iſſuing out of him, he died miſerably.</p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Joſephus</hi> endeth his Hiſtory of the Deſtruction of <hi>Judea.</hi> But his <hi>Jewiſh Antiquities</hi> he finiſhed not till the <hi>Thirteenth</hi> of <hi>Domitian,</hi> when he was Fifty ſix years old, as himſelf teſtifieth at the end of his Work.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude all with an hearty Prayer to God for the <hi>Converſion of the Jews,</hi> and the <hi>
